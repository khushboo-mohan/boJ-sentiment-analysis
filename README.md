# Bank of Japan Monetary Policy Speeches – Sentiment Analysis

This project analyzes sentiment and narrative tone in speeches delivered by the Bank of Japan (BoJ), using text-mining and NLP methods. It is part of my research interest in Japan’s economic stagnation and policy communication.

## Background
Central bank communication influences expectations and economic behavior. BoJ speeches provide insights into risk perception, policy uncertainty, and narrative framing.

## Data
English translations of BoJ speeches from the official website.

Limitation: Translations may alter tone; a future extension will use Japanese text.

## Methods
- Text preprocessing
- VADER sentiment analysis
- TF-IDF keyword extraction
- Trend visualization

## Findings
- Mostly neutral sentiment
- Noticeable dips during major shocks (2008, 2011, 2020)
- Themes: inflation expectations, financial stability, market functioning
