"Apr. 3, 1996","Speech given by Yasuo Matsushita, Governor of the Bank of Japan, to the Keizai (Economic) Club in Tokyo on April 3, 1996 (Recent Monetary and Economic Conditions and Issues Facing the Japanese Financial System) ","Introduction
Thank you for the kind invitation to the Keizai Club. It is a great honor to have this opportunity to speak to such distinguished guests from various fields.

Since becoming Governor of the Bank of Japan in December 1994, I have made it my rule to focus on a specific theme when speaking on this kind of occasion. Today, however, I will take up the various questions and concerns often raised by people in economic circles and by the public, and present my thoughts on these issues.

As you know, the Japanese economy today is faced with two tasks: to ensure economic recovery and to restore the credibility of the financial system. The nation is presently in a very delicate and therefore crucial phase on both fronts, with still many uncertainties, but slightly brighter prospects opening up.

Given this situation, the questions and concerns about Japan that the Bank encounters are quite varied. In my speech today, I will group these issues into three broad categories: (1) those related to the current economic condition of Japan and monetary policy management; (2) those concerning immediate problems facing the financial system; and (3) those related to future financial institution supervision.

I will be covering a broad canvas today. However, I would like you to understand, through my talk, in what sense the Bank of Japan attaches importance to the market, and how the Bank intends to utilize the intrinsic functions of the market in this age of a worldwide transition to market economies. These will, in fact, be the common thread that will run through my entire talk today.

Let me start with the recent economic and financial conditions and monetary policy management.

Recent Economic and Financial Conditions and Monetary Policy Management
Current Economic Conditions and Prospects
I believe that a moderate economic recovery is beginning in Japan. In terms of demand, public and housing investments continue to grow significantly, and personal consumption and business fixed investment are on a moderate recovery trend. Reflecting such developments in demand, production is also trending upward in general, although with fluctuations. Inventory adjustment also seems to be progressing on the whole, while excess inventory remains in some segments of the materials industry.

However, I am often asked, both in and outside Japan, whether continued recovery is assured, and how much possibility there is of the recovery running out of steam, especially since the Japanese economy stalled in1995 after barely starting a long-awaited recovery.

In fact, recovery this time has, up until now, been dependent mainly on public investment and interest rate-sensitive housing investment; namely, it has been supported by the effects of monetary and fiscal policies. Thus, the important question now is whether the current momentum of recovery will gather further strength and stimulate private demand such as business fixed investment and personal consumption. In light of the following factors, we at the Bank believe that compared to 1995, there is a far smaller risk that the recovery will be disrupted.

First, corporate profits are gradually increasing and, in addition, firms’ profitability has been strengthened due to restructuring efforts.

The key to a full-scale, self-sustained recovery is more vigorous business activity in terms of production, employment, and investment, and corporate profits provide the foundation for such activity.

The current profits-to-sales ratio of large manufacturers is slowly recovering after declining to the 2 percent level in fiscal 1993, the lowest level since the first oil crisis in 1973-75. In the second half of fiscal 1995, the ratio appears to have risen to almost 4 percent. In past economic recoveries, this ratio reached 4 percent approximately one year after the recovery began, when the forces of recovery became fairly robust. This time, it has taken almost three years since hitting bottom to reach that level. This in itself is symbolic of the depth of the recession triggered by the bursting of the bubble as well as of the size of the structural adjustment pressures during those three years.

Low corporate profits inevitably make business activities vulnerable to external shocks, and thus, firms tend to become cautious about investment. It is true that the economic recovery in 1995 was affected by excessive yen appreciation. But the economy stalled essentially because the appreciation occurred when the recovery was premature in terms of the level of corporate profits.

Recent profit trends of the non-manufacturing sector and small and medium-sized manufacturers have also been showing improvement. This may be taken as an encouraging sign of the sustainability of the current recovery.

Second, there now is much less risk of a deflationary spiral--a vicious circle in which price declines put downward pressures on income and in turn on economic activity, thus leading to further price declines--which has been a concern for the past two years.

Looking at price indices, the annual rate of change in the consumer price index fell below zero in mid-1995, but has been positive since autumn 1995,although only slightly. The rate in terms of the wholesale price index is still negative, but it has stopped declining further. Above all, the recovery in corporate profits as mentioned earlier and an improvement in wage conditions, as seen in the results of the 1996 spring labor offensive, are clear evidence that a deflationary spiral has been prevented.

As significant price discrepancies still exist between Japan and overseas, it is likely that downward pressures on prices will persist. However, price declines resulting from improved productivity brought about by increased competition and new technologies may benefit the public and may lead to renewed economic growth. The recent recovery in consumer demand, centering on personal computers, and the launch of new types of distribution businesses are cases in point.

Third, the excessive yen appreciation has been corrected. Although the exchange rate may still fluctuate from time to time due to speculation, weakening of inflationary pressures in the United States and a decrease in Japan's current account surplus have reduced the upward pressure on the yen's exchange rate.

Causes of Concern and Monetary Policy Management
It thus seems that compared to last year, a greater number of the preconditions necessary for leading the Japanese economy onto a sustainable recovery path are in place.

Having said that, there remains some cause for concern regarding economic prospects. What should be borne in mind include the developments of the world economy, which has been slowing somewhat, and consequences of this on the Japanese economy, the meager growth of monetary aggregates, and land prices which do not yet seem to have hit bottom. Most important of all, however, is the pace and scope of recovery of business fixed investment.

The results of the Bank of Japan's Tankan--Short-Term Economic Survey of Enterprises in Japan in February and of other surveys show that while large firms plan to increase their fixed investment somewhat in fiscal 1996 for the second consecutive year, small and medium-sized companies are planning a further cut back from the reduced fixed investment of 1995. The prospect for fiscal 1996 business fixed investment may later become brighter, considering that the figures in the above surveys were likely understated since many firms had not finalized their investment plans by the survey deadlines. Furthermore, if corporate profits continue to improve, then this will encourage firms to add to their business fixed investment. Given these and other uncertainties, I feel it is still too early to draw any conclusion as to the strength and scope of the recovery of business fixed investment.

As companies will soon be finalizing their business plans for the new fiscal year, the present period is crucial in determining whether the economy can attain a self-sustained recovery led by private demand. Therefore, in managing monetary policy, we at the Bank believe that we should watch various economic developments carefully, especially the investment behavior of the private sector, with a view to laying a solid foundation for economic recovery.

The Bank of Japan's Interpretation of Market Interest Rate Movements
Looking at recent developments in the financial markets, long-term interest rates have risen gradually since late 1995, and short-term rates underwent a relatively large swing from February of this year to early March. I would like to explain the Bank's interpretation of these market rate movements and respond to the several questions I have received.

First, let me briefly review the market rate developments in recent months. The long-term interest rate on benchmark Japanese government bonds stayed at around 2.7 percent for some time after the monetary easing measure in September 1995, but the rate began to rise slowly at the end of the year, and more recently has been at around 3.1 percent. In the case of short-term market rates, upward pressures began to build in mid-February, pushing the three-month Euro-yen rate, for example, up by 0.3 percentage point. However, with the results of the February Tankan survey published in early March, which pointed to a more gradual recovery than had been expected by market participants, the short-term rates once again declined to the level seen before the rise in mid-February.

When interest rate changes as large as these occur, people tend to view such movements as disruptive to the market and anticipate market instability.

On this score, my view is totally different: I think that the market is skillfully seeking a level consistent with economic developments, based on the information it has absorbed.

My interpretation of the market rate developments of the past several months is that the slow rise of long-term rates since late 1995 reflects the steadily improving economic situation. And the fairly large shifts in the short-term rates in February indicate that the market, after fully digesting the implications of official statements and of newly released economic indicators, arrived at the conclusion that although the economy is recovering, the pace is still moderate and will likely remain so for some time.

I have been asked in connection with these market rate developments whether a rise in market rates anticipating a firm economic recovery will adversely affect economic developments in the immediate future.

It is indeed true that, when expectations of economic recovery grow in the market, this alone often triggers a rise in market interest rates. However, higher expectations of recovery also mean an expectation of improved profitability, or a rise in the expected rate of return on projects. When considering entry into new business areas or whether to make new fixed investment, entrepreneurs essentially base their decisions on whether the expected rate of return on projects is sufficiently high compared to the prevailing market interest rates. In other words, it is only natural that higher expectations of economic recovery should accompany a rise in interest rates. Such a rise should not immediately constrain business activity to the extent that it is consistent with the improvement in the expected rate of return, allowing a rise in the market rates and an economic recovery to proceed concurrently. This is often observed in normal recovery phases.

I also hear concern these days that a rise in interest rates in Japan might lead to higher rates internationally, with a negative effect on the world economy. It is true that with growing international linkage between financial markets, a rise in interest rates in one country, especially in real interest rates, may extend to other countries. However, if the higher rates in Japan reflect Japan's economic expansion, this should increase global demand by boosting the nation's imports. A rise in interest rates in Japan due to economic recovery, therefore, may push up interest rates internationally, but it is too simplistic to think that such a rise would immediately dampen the world economy. To illustrate this point more clearly, consider two countries with close economic relationships, and suppose economic recovery takes place in one country. If the interest rate linkage were the dominant channel through which the two countries influenced each other, this would mean that one country's recovery would necessarily have a negative impact on the other's economic activity. But this is intuitively not so and is not borne out by experience.

What is important is whether interest rates are determined in line with the developments of the real economy and with the expectations of people based on those developments. There certainly are times when market rates overshoot for various reasons. However, as demonstrated by the recent interest rate movements in February and March, market rates may swing up and down, but sooner or later will settle down to a reasonable level. Based on such understanding, we at the Bank carefully examine the outlook for corporate profits and growth expectations to judge whether the interest rate level is consistent with the expectations of people at that time.

As I mentioned earlier, the Bank of Japan's stance in managing monetary policy is to consolidate the foundation for economic recovery. We at the Bank will continue to monitor market trends carefully on the basis of this policy stance to see what kind of response we receive from the market rates.

The Japanese Financial System
Immediate Issues
Let me now turn to issues related to the Japanese financial system.

With regard to the jusen (housing loan company) issue, which is at present of utmost importance, the Diet has resumed deliberations on the budget proposal for fiscal 1996, which includes an outlay of government funds for the resolution of this issue, and on jusen-related bills.

The going has been difficult in Diet deliberations, above all because the public’s doubts on utilizing government funds for the resolution of the jusen problem have not been dispelled. There have been many twists and turns to the jusen issue, and the interests of the parties concerned are also extremely complicated. It therefore seems inevitable that time will be needed to gain a sufficient understanding from the public of the solution to this problem.

However, the current resolution proposal was devised following thorough discussions among the parties concerned. Furthermore, as I have stated on other occasions, use of government funds is essential if we are to solve the nonperforming-asset problem promptly and restore the strength of the Japanese financial system, while protecting the valuable deposits of the public.

In addition, bills to organize a comprehensive framework for resolving not only the jusen issue but the nonperforming-asset problem as a whole are to be submitted to the Diet. These bills include important legislative measures needed (1) to carry out a revision of the Deposit Insurance System;(2) to expedite the disposal of failing financial institutions; and (3)to take prompt corrective action in relation to troubled institutions.

Therefore, although it may take time, I strongly hope that serious deliberation will continue in the Diet, and that the fiscal 1996 budget and the jusen-related bills will be passed smoothly with the public's support for the measures for resolving not only the jusen issue but also the nonperforming-asset problem as a whole.

However, resolution of this issue will still mean there is much to be done to solve the nonperforming-asset problem and to restore the domestic and international credibility of the Japanese financial system. In this regard, it is most important to actually put into practice as soon as possible the comprehensive resolution framework introduced by the new laws to bring about the resolution of the problems of failing financial institutions.

At the same time, it is essential that individual financial institutions accelerate their write-offs of nonperforming loans. In this respect, significant progress can be expected in view of the policies adopted by the major banks in closing their books for the half-year term which ended in March 1996.As the solution to the jusen issue is yet to be determined, it will be somewhat difficult to settle the accounts at the end of this term. Nevertheless, the major banks seem resolved to make lump-sum write-offs of nonperforming loans including those other than jusen loans. Quite a few banks project significant losses for the term due to these write-offs. This stance of financial institutions should be held in high regard, and it is hoped that creditors and investors both in Japan and overseas will not be confounded by the resultant financial reports.

In addition to solving the nonperforming-asset problem, financial institutions must also make positive efforts to perform their financial functions in a way that will adequately support Japan's economic recovery and further development. This will require them to set forth their management strategies, including decisive restructuring, such as scaling down of non-profitable operations, cost reductions, and a shifting of emphasis to areas with comparative advantage. This setting out of management strategies is also important for procuring external funds to improve their capital adequacy. In this connection, let me briefly discuss the issue of capital increase, which is one of the means available to financial institutions to improve their capital adequacy.

Issues Involved in Capital Increase
Since last year, I have stated from time to time that it is essential to utilize the functions of the capital markets in restoring the capital adequacy of financial institutions which has deteriorated due to nonperforming assets.

One recent advance in this respect is that the guidelines which, in consideration of the sluggish stock market, had placed constraints on capital increase through equity financing at market price are to be abolished. This de fact liberalization of capital increase through market-price equity financing will mean expanding management opportunities for financial institutions, which urgently need to rebuild capital adequacy, and for ordinary business firms as well. I very much appreciate the efforts of those who have contributed to this process.

What I often hear regarding the Bank of Japan's argument for the utilization of the capital market is the concern that liberalized market-price equity financing might trigger a rush of capital increases, loosen equity market conditions, and thereby amplify downward pressures on stock prices. This could unfavorably affect both economic recovery and the solution of the nonperforming-asset problem.

However, I believe that such a situation would occur only if the stock market were not functioning properly.

Rises and falls in stock prices essentially hinge on the outlook for a firm’s business performance. The reaction of stock prices to equity financing depends on how the funds raised will be used, or whether the profit outlook after equity financing is satisfying to investors. In other words, stock prices are not affected by the equity financing itself, but by the firm’s management plan. In this respect, the critical factors are how an institution devises and discloses its management strategy, including restructuring measures. If the management plan announced ahead of the capital increase is satisfactory to the investors, stock prices will not decline; if itis unsatisfactory, stock prices will quickly respond and force a review of the equity financing program itself. In that case, the restructuring plan or the disclosure method may have to be reviewed, and it might also be necessary to consider financing through other means, for example, through subordinated debt.

I recognize that, in reality, stock markets do not always operate in such a manner. However, restricting the behavior of stock issuers and investors will not provide fundamental solutions. If the problem lies in the functioning of the market, then measures should be taken which would improve it, such as promoting further disclosure and developing the market infrastructure.

Discussions by market participants in this regard are, I hear, in fact proceeding very much in the direction I have just described. With regard to financial institutions, I hope that they will present clear-cut management plans that incorporate drastic restructuring in order to reestablish their credibility with both domestic and overseas investors and depositors.

Financial Institution Supervision and the Role of the Bank of Japan
The Significance of Financial System Oversight
I mentioned that heated discussions have occurred among various parties regarding the ways and means of restructuring and strengthening the Japanese financial system while addressing the immediate problem of nonperforming assets. Other issues which have attracted much attention are financial institution supervision and financial administration, which I would like to take up in the remaining time.

The administrative supervision of financial institutions in Japan is undertaken by the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries, and other relevant ministries and agencies, as well as by local governments. The Bank of Japan also conducts regular on-site examinations and daily monitoring of financial institutions in order to stay informed on their market behavior and on their financial and management conditions.

I had an occasion recently to discuss the Bank's basic thoughts on this issue. In brief, I said that the functions of examination and monitoring are indispensable in allowing the Bank of Japan to fulfill its missions of maintaining the stability of the currency and ensuring the stability of the financial system, and that these functions are performed in close coordination with the policy and operational management of the Bank.

Today, I would like to go back to the basics and take a somewhat broader approach, sharing with you my thoughts on what is demanded of financial institution supervision and what the role of the Bank of Japan is in this regard.

The first thing I would like to point out is that the basic philosophy underlying the design of the institutional framework and the conduct of economic policy management in the years to come should be to fully utilize, in all aspects of the Japanese economy, the inherent strength of the market economy--the forces of innovation induced by competition. Structural policies such as deregulation, which is currently being promoted, are also based on the same philosophy.

This philosophy also applies to the financial industry. As typically shown by the development of financial services in Europe and the United States, the innovative strength generated by competition is indispensable to encouraging a further development of the financial industry itself, and also to increasing the efficiency of the financial functions which support the country's economic activities.

While that is the case, we must note that the financial system--the network linking financial institutions--has a unique feature not seen in non financial industries. That is the existence of systemic risk--the risk that a problem in one part of the system might quickly spread through the entire system.

The risk arises due to the fact that (1) a large part of the payment of funds resulting from all kinds of economic activity is made through interbank settlements, and therefore, financial institutions are linked in an intricate network of lending and borrowing of funds as well as of daily settlement of financial transactions; and (2) both the network itself and the individual financial institutions which constitute the network are underpinned by credit, or credibility, which is in large measure a psychological factor.

The financial system is an important infrastructure supporting a country’s economic activity, not simply in terms of intermediating funds between borrowers and lenders, but also because it provides a settlement system. Any malfunctioning of the settlement system will undermine confidence in deposits and daily fund settlements, seriously affecting every aspect of people’s daily lives.

Therefore, in the financial system an appropriate balance must at all times be struck between the need to draw out the dynamism of the financial market and the need to secure the stability of the system. This is an extremely difficult task, as the most desirable balance between the two requirements will naturally differ depending on the country's prevailing economic situation as well as on past developments.

For example, from the days of turmoil immediately after World War II through the reconstruction period, the most urgent task for Japan was to rehabilitate the intermediation functions of financial institutions and utilize those functions for the policy objective of economic reconstruction. In the next stage, when the Deposit Insurance System was as yet underdeveloped, and the operations of financial institutions and financial instruments were not as complex as they are today, it was necessary and indeed effective to give priority to ensuring sound financial institution management by restricting the behavior of institutions through regulations and individual guidance.

Things have changed drastically since then, however. Interest rates have been liberalized, and the walls between different kinds of financial business are being lowered. Japanese financial markets are becoming sufficiently mature in terms of diversity of market participants, market size, transaction volume, as well as the establishment of the interest rate mechanism. Growing international competition in the financial industry, diversifying needs for financial services, and the development of high-tech financial instruments have significantly changed the environment. Thanks to these developments, business opportunities of financial institutions are expanding, but at the same time, the risks involved in their business are increasing.

If the past practice of restricting the behavior of financial institutions were to be continued, the following problems would likely emerge.

First, the innovative forces induced by competition would not work fully, preventing the Japanese financial sector from developing into an internationally competitive, strong, and efficient industry. As a result, financial institutions would not be able to respond adequately to the diversifying financial needs of firms and individuals. In fact, most of the technological innovations in the financial industry to date have originated in the United States or Europe, and it is undeniable that Japan's achievements in this area have been less impressive than the numerous technological innovations presented to the world by the nation's nonfinancial industries.

Second, as it is impossible to regulate every aspect of financial institutions’ increasingly complex and diverse behavior, regulations and constraints imposed with the aim of securing stability could only lead to increased risks in financial institution management. For example, regulations could induce excessive behavior in unregulated areas or hamper overall allocation and hedging of risks.

Incidentally, excessive lending by financial institutions during the bubble period is often perceived to have been a manifestation of the problems inherent in a deregulation process, which relates to the problem I just mentioned. It was also from this very perspective that the Bank of Japan abolished its so-called ""window guidance,"" the system of providing direct guidance to influence the lending activities of financial institutions.

In view of this, I conclude that the basic philosophy behind financial institution supervision in the days ahead should be, first of all, to essentially trust the market mechanism and encourage financial institutions to base their behavior on the principle of self-responsibility, instead of attempting to correct their behavior through individual regulations and guidance. Second, in order to ensure financial system stability, what is needed is to carefully monitor the operation of the system as a whole together with the behavior of individual institutions and, should a problem occur, to take the necessary measures to prevent its impact from spreading. In other words, it is now more essential to oversee the functioning of the entire financial system rather than to regulate and supervise individual institutions.

I have often stated my basic thinking on the expected future role of financial administration--that is, (1) to establish the minimum of highly transparent rules needed to ensure sound financial institution management; (2) to oversee compliance with these rules; and (3) to devise, if necessary, prompt corrective measures for individual financial institutions. All these, again, are based on the same basic philosophy outlined earlier.

The Role of the Central Bank
What role then should the central bank play within the revised system of financial institution supervision?

As you are aware, the Bank of Japan has two missions: maintaining the stability of the currency and ensuring the stability of the financial system. With regard to the latter, the Bank is expected to fulfill its duties by (1) securing smooth operation of the payment and settlement systems, which constitute the core of the financial system; and (2) preventing erosion of market confidence in the system by exercising its lender-of-last-resort function in the case of an emergency.

The basic thinking behind these roles is to ensure the stability of the financial system by utilizing the market mechanism and avoiding excessive reliance on individual regulations and guidance. This thinking is in line with the view I have expressed on financial system oversight.

Central banks in other countries also play important roles, one way or another, in overseeing the financial system. This is precisely because the objectives and operations of the central bank are inseparably linked to the functions of financial system oversight.

In the United States, for example, the Federal Reserve plays an important part in bank supervision and examination alongside the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, and state authorities. In the United Kingdom, the Bank of England exclusively undertakes this task.

In Germany and France, independent administrative bodies undertake bank supervision; the Federal Banking Supervisory Office (FBSO) in Germany and the Banking Commission (CB) in France. In the case of Germany, however, a statutory requirement mandates the submission of audit documentation to the Bundesbank in addition to the FBSO, and thus the central bank in effect plays a major role. In France, the CB is chaired by the central bank governor, and its secretariat is established within the Bank of France.

Accordingly, the central bank in many countries plays a major role in monitoring and supervising the operation of the entire financial system and in securing financial system stability. Central banks are therefore required to make unyielding efforts to improve their functions of financial system oversight.

I would like to discuss more specifically the points the Bank of Japan has emphasized in recent years.

First, to have an accurate grasp of the market behavior and risks of financial institutions, it has become increasingly important to upgrade the Bank’s on-site examination and daily monitoring skills so that they adequately cover derivatives and other new financial transactions in addition to conventional lending operations. The Bank has recently organized a financial engineering team--a group studying new financial technologies, particularly the accompanying risks--which will support the development of new methods of on-site examination and monitoring and will assist risk analysis by the Bank. The Bank has already begun cooperation with overseas central banks in this regard.

Second, it will be important in the future to check and monitor financial institutions' internal risk management systems. A greater sophistication of on-site examination and daily monitoring methods is an absolute requirement in overseeing the risks in the financial system, but that alone is not sufficient. As financial transactions expand and grow increasingly complex, a more effective way to strengthen risk management is to encourage financial institutions to improve their internal risk management systems, rather than for authorities themselves to try to assess the risks involved in individual financial transactions.

Third, with financial institutions engaging in an increasing number of cross-border financial transactions as they become internationally active, it has become indispensable to monitor financial systems at the international level. One good example was the response by the monetary authorities of various countries to the Mexican currency crisis in 1994. International coordination of risk management--for instance, at the meetings of the Bank for International Settlements--is becoming increasingly significant in securing the stability of a country's financial system.

Conclusion
I have so far explained the concept of financial system oversight and discussed the roles of the central bank, citing some examples from overseas. In connection with this question of the future supervision of financial institutions, I am frequently asked for my views concerning revision of the Bank of Japan Law. Let me share with you some of my thoughts on this issue, although I may be repeating myself since I have discussed the issue on certain occasions in the past.

As you may be aware, the existing Bank of Japan Law was enacted in 1942, during World War II. That being the case, some aspects of the law, including the expressions used, no longer suit the present circumstances. The extensive supervisory authority over the Bank granted to the government reflects an era of strong government control.

Interest rate policy, however, was placed under the exclusive purview of the Bank of Japan in the 1949 revision of the law, whereby the Policy Board, the Bank's decision-making body, was established to take charge of monetary policy decisions, including interest rate changes. In addition, the various roles undertaken by the Bank of Japan in running the settlement system and in ensuring the stability of the financial system--for example, through the conduct of on-site examinations and daily monitoring--have been construed as conforming to the Bank's duty of maintaining and fostering a safe and sound financial system as stated by the law, although the roles themselves have not been specifically stipulated.

Thus, while it has some problems, the existing Bank of Japan Law has been administered very carefully, with the understanding of all concerned, so as not to hinder the Bank in fulfilling its missions. With regard to the independence of monetary policy, I wish to state unequivocally in the light of my own experience during the past 16 months since becoming Governor, that the Bank of Japan has managed policy based on its own responsibility and judgment.

Due to the nature of the existing law, however, the Bank may not be able to secure appropriate management of monetary policy while maintaining the credibility of a central bank, in view of the continuing trend toward market economies and globalization of financial markets.

I therefore consider it necessary to review the existing Bank of Japan Law to accommodate economic and financial changes and to make it comparable with the central bank laws of other countries.

The Bank of Japan Law is one of the basic laws governing the monetary and financial activities of Japan. Its revision will have a major influence on the Japanese economy over a long period of time, and therefore will need to be discussed in depth and from a broad perspective by the public. If this view wins public support and if the question of central banking is to be discussed, we at the Bank are prepared to contribute actively to that discussion.

I would like to conclude by expressing the Bank of Japan's hope that constructive discussions in the future will indeed bear fruit.",,Positive,0.8310201168,"はじめに
　日本経済は、ここ数年、バブル経済の後遺症を克服しつつ、新たな時代にふさわしい経済構造を構築するという、たいへん重い課題に直面して参りました。昨年も、各方面でこうした課題への厳しい取り組みが続きましたが、それと同時に、幾つかの側面で重要な前進がみられ、将来につながる成果があがり始めた年でもあったように思います。

　まず、景気の回復という課題については、デフレ・スパイラルさえ懸念された一昨年とは異なり、景気は緩やかな回復歩調を辿ってきました。この間、アジア諸国との競争激化など新しい国際環境に対する企業の適応も、着実に進んでいるように窺われます。また、いわゆる金融関連６法の成立やこれを受けた住専問題の処理など、金融システム問題の解決に向けても大きな進展がみられました。

　さらに、昨年は、中央銀行制度の改革に関する取り組みが動き出した年でもありました。総理のもとに設けられた中央銀行研究会で、５０年振りの日銀法改正の基本的な指針が示されました。これを受けて、現在、法改正に向けての具体的な検討が進められています。また、金融機関の検査・監督体制の見直しや、橋本総理が提唱された「日本版ビッグバン」構想など、金融市場・金融行政全般の抜本的な改革に関する建設的な議論も盛んに行われています。

　視野を海外に拡げてみますと、ここ数年、世界経済は大きな変革期を迎えております。アジア諸国や旧計画経済圏の市場経済圏への参入、技術革新を梃子とする金融市場の国際的な連関の緊密化など、変化の潮流は多岐にわたっていますが、あえて要約してみれば、「市場化」と「グローバリゼーション」という２つの大きな方向性が浮かび上がってくるように思います。

　このような世界経済の動きの中で、わが国経済が新たな発展を遂げていくためには、真に市場原理が貫徹され、競争が促進されるよう、経済構造を抜本的に見直していく必要があります。また、そうした取り組みは、企業活動の活性化を通じて、インフレなき持続的成長経路への移行を確実なものとするうえでも、好ましい効果を及ぼすものであります。私が、これまで機会あるごとに、「規制緩和などの構造政策の実施が伴ってこそ、金融緩和の効果が十分に発揮されるものと考える」と申し上げてきたのも、こうした趣旨であります。

　以上を踏まえると、本年は、昨年始まった前向きの動きをさらに進め、日本経済の「改革実行の年」にしなければならないと思います。以下、このような基本認識に立って、経済・金融面の幾つかの問題につき申し述べたいと思います。

国内経済の動向
　まず、国内の経済情勢についてでありますが、景気は緩やかな回復を続けており、そうしたもとで、景気回復力の底固さが次第に増してきているように窺われます。

　最終需要面をみると、公共投資の伸びはさすがに頭打ちとなってきていますが、住宅投資は引続き高水準を維持しています。設備投資も、増収・増益基調の持続のもとで回復傾向を続けています。また、個人消費は、昨年夏場には、天候不順などの影響からやや足踏み気味の動きとなりましたが、秋口以降は、自動車などの耐久消費財を中心に、緩やかな伸びを取り戻しました。さらに、これまで景気回復の足を引張ってきたネット輸出は、一昨年来の円高修正の効果から、昨年後半以降は、それまでの減少傾向に歯止めがかかっています。

　こうした最終需要の動向に加えて、鉄鋼など一部素材業種における在庫調整の進捗もあって、生産は昨年前半の横這い圏内の動きを脱して、最近では、むしろ増加テンポを速めているように窺われます。

　この間、物価面では、円高修正の影響で輸入物価が上昇をみたものの、国内物価はこれまでのところ、それを吸収して落着いた基調で推移しています。

先行きの景気動向と金融政策運営
　経済の現状に関する私どもの認識は、以上申し述べたとおりですが、かねて申し上げてきたように、現在のわが国経済には、景気の回復を促す循環的な力と、景気の加速を制約する構造的な力とが同時に作用しています。従って、本年の経済情勢を考える上でも、この２つの力がどう展開していくかを見極めることが大切です。

　このうち、わが国経済が直面する構造調整の圧力、すなわち産業構造再編やバランスシート調整の圧力には、引続き根強いものがあります。景気の回復が続いているにもかかわらず、「緩やかな」という形容詞がなかなかとれないのも、こうしたことによる面が大きいように思います。しかし、そうはいっても、長期に亘るリストラ努力や最近の収益改善のもとで、企業の適応はそれなりに着実に進んでいます。産業構造の転換という面をみても、移動体通信をはじめとして、新たなリーディング産業が育つ兆しがみられています。従って、構造調整の圧力は今後もある程度続くことを覚悟する必要はありますが、企業の対応が進むにつれて、その影響は次第に減衰していくと考えていてよいように思われます。

　他方、景気の回復を促す力についてみると、昨年前半までの景気の回復は、政策面からの後押しが大きく寄与しました。しかし、その後は、政策効果の浸透などにつれて、企業収益が改善し、それに応じて設備投資態度や雇用態度が前向きになるという動きも、徐々に拡がってきました。この間、資本ストックの調整が相当進捗していることと併せ考えると、回復を促す循環的な力は、ゆっくりと、しかし着実に働いてきているものと受け止めています。

　今後、財政再建への取り組みを通じて、財政面からの景気支持力は低下していくことが予想されていますが、そのもとでも、日本経済が全体として持続的な景気の回復を続けていくためには、このような民間需要の自律的な回復力が鍵となることは申すまでもありません。

　最近の動きからみて、今後、民間需要を軸とする循環メカニズムがさらに強まることは十分期待できますが、この点はなお見極めが必要でしょう。

　私どもとしては、日本経済のインフレなき持続的成長経路への移行を確実なものとするために、以上のような点を踏まえ、情勢の展開を注意深く見守りつつ、本年も適切な金融政策運営に努めて参る所存です。

　また、こうした課題を達成する上では、マクロ政策だけでなく、規制緩和をはじめとする構造政策を併せて実施することが不可欠です。これまでも情報通信分野の規制緩和や大店法緩和が、移動体通信の設備投資急増や小売業における新規出店の積極化を通じ、景気回復に大きく貢献してきました。今後とも、この面での政府の強力なリーダーシップを期待したいと考えております。

金融システム問題
　金融システム面では、不良債権問題を早期に克服するとともに、２１世紀に向けて効率的で安定的かつ活力のあるシステムを構築することが一層重要な課題となっております。

　不良債権問題への取り組みという面では、昨年は大きな進展をみました。６月には、いわゆる金融関連６法が国会で成立し、それらに盛り込まれた諸措置により、不良債権の早期処理を促すとともに、万一の金融機関破綻といった事態にも迅速に対処するための枠組みが整備されました。また、その下で、住専問題という、極めて多数の利害が複雑に絡み合い、それ故に解決の難しかった問題も、最終処理に向かって動き出しました。

　金融機関自身の不良債権問題に対する取り組み姿勢も一段と積極化しています。平成８年３月期決算、および９月期中間決算では、多くの金融機関が償却や引当を積極的に行い、これにより今後処理を要する不良債権の残高は着実な減少をみております。

　このように、金融機関の不良債権問題への対応は、着実に進展していますが、なお、多くの残された問題があります。例えば、昨年は、巨額の負債を抱えたノンバンクの倒産事例が幾つかみられましたが、そうした住専以外のノンバンク問題への対応も、不良債権問題の最終的な解決を図るに当たっては、避けて通ることの出来ない課題です。金融機関においては、こうしたノンバンク向け債権を含め、不良債権処理を早期に完了することが何よりも重要です。このほかにも、不良債権処理の過程で減少をみている自己資本の復元といった問題や、リストラの推進、さらには経営の抜本的見直しなど、今後とも真剣に取り組まなければならない課題は依然少なくありません。

　日本銀行としても、こうした不良債権問題の克服の過程で、金融システム全体の安定維持の観点からどうしても必要がある場合には、これまでと同様、中央銀行として、取るべき措置を躊躇なく講じていく方針です。その場合においても、日本銀行が金融機関の破綻処理に関連して資金供与を行う際には、これまでも繰り返し表明してきている幾つかの条件ないし原則を満たしていることが前提であることはいうまでもありません。すなわち、1.システミック・リスク顕現化の惧れがあること、2.日本銀行の資金供与が処理方策上不可欠であること、3.モラル・ハザード防止の観点から関係者の責任が十分に求められること、4.日本銀行の財務の健全性に十分配慮したものであること、であります。

　以上のような不良債権問題への対応とともに、健全で強固な金融システムの再構築に向けての前向きな取り組み努力も重要な課題です。この点についても、昨年来、既に幾つかの成果がみられているところです。例えば、金融機関のトレーディング勘定への時価会計導入が決定されたほか、金融機関においても、不良債権の開示範囲の拡大や、マーケットリスクに関する創意工夫をこらしたディスクロージャーが始まっています。

　また、決済システム面でも、市場関係者のご努力により、国債のローリング決済が実現したほか、一般債決済システムの改善や外為円決済システムへの新たなリスク管理策導入の動きなど大きな前進がみられました。さらに、日本銀行では、先般、日銀当座預金決済におけるシステミック・リスクを削減するため、日銀ネットの「時点決済」を廃止し「即時決済」のみを利用可能とすること、すなわち日銀ネットの「ＲＴＧＳ化」が必要と判断し、関係者の方々と協議しつつ、その実現に向けて努力していくこととしたところです。

　また、昨年11月には、橋本総理が2001年までの実現を目標とする包括的な金融システム改革案、いわゆる「日本版ビッグバン」構想を指示されました。同構想では、「市場の改革」と「金融機関の不良債権処理」の２つが、直ちに取り組むべき課題として位置付けられ、さらに「Free」（市場原理が働く自由な市場に）、「Fair」（透明で信頼できる市場に）、「Global」（国際的で時代を先取りする市場に）の３つの原則が、市場改革の基本理念として掲げられています。これらの原則は、金融・経済の市場化・グローバル化が一段と進展するもとで、我が国金融市場、金融システムを効率的かつ柔軟なものへと再構築していくに当たって、基本理念とすべきものです。また、改革に含まれる具体的な検討項目は、各種規制の撤廃を始めとして、法制度、会計制度、金融税制、監督体制など多岐にわたっています。既に昨年末には外国為替等審議会・法制特別部会が為銀制度の廃止等抜本的な外国為替業務の自由化の方針を打出すなど、具体的な改革に向けての努力が始まっています。

　このような構造改革は、一時的には様々な苦痛を伴うものですが、21世紀の日本経済が活力を保っていくためには、避けて通れない取り組みであると考えています。今後、この構想に掲げられた３つの基本原則に則って、早期に具体策がまとめられ、速やかに実施に移されることが期待されるところです。日本銀行としても、中央銀行としての立場から、様々な場や機会を捉えて、その実現に積極的に貢献して参りたいと考えています。

日銀法改正問題
　次に、日本銀行法の改正問題について申し述べます。

　日銀法の改正は、新しい時代に向けて、我が国の金融システムを再構築していくうえでの重要な課題の一つとして位置づけられます。現在の日銀法は、昭和１７年に制定されたものであり、戦時体制下の立法であることを色濃く反映した規定が随所にみられます。昭和２４年に政策委員会制度を設けるための法改正が行われましたが、法律の条文の大半は、戦時立法のまま残されました。このため、市場化・国際化の進展といった、その後の内外の金融・経済情勢の変化に対応して、中央銀行のあり方を見直す必要性が高まっておりました。こうした状況を背景に、昨年７月、内閣総理大臣の下に「中央銀行研究会」が設けられ、中央銀行制度のあり方に関し、公平中立な立場から、検討が行われることとなりました。この研究会では、７月末の初回会合以降、精力的に審議が進められ、１１月１２日に、報告書が取りまとめられました。

　「中央銀行制度の改革」と題するこの研究会の報告書は、２１世紀の金融システムの中核として相応しい中央銀行のあり方に関して基本的な指針を示すとともに、日銀法改正を始めとする中央銀行関連諸制度の今後の改革の方向性も明らかにしており、日本銀行としても、これを重く受け止めるべきものと考えております。

　報告書は、「開かれた独立性を求めて」というその副題からも明らかなように、「独立性」と「透明性」という２つの視点を、報告の基本に据えています。報告書の内容を具体的にみますと、まず、日本銀行の目的・運営理念として、「物価の安定」と「金融システムの安定」の２つが掲げられています。その上で、日本銀行の金融政策運営については、「物価の安定を図ることを通じて、国民経済の健全な発展に資することを基本とすべき」とされており、大変意義深いことです。

　さらに、研究会の報告書では、「インフレ的な経済運営を求める外部からの圧力を排し、物価安定を達成するためには、中央銀行に独立性を付与する必要がある」との考え方に立ち、「金融政策の分野において、日本銀行の最高意思決定機関である政策委員会を強化した上で、この政策委員会が最終的な判断を行うこととすべきである」旨が明記されています。また、こうした日本銀行の独立性を強化するための措置として、政府による業務命令権や役員の解任権を廃止するとの考え方が示されています。併せて、そうした独立性の強化と表裏の関係として、政策決定過程の透明性を確保することにより、アカウンタビリティ、すなわち説明責任を果たしていくことが重要であると指摘しています。

　以上が中央銀行研究会報告書の大きな枠組みですが、日本銀行が独立した中央銀行として、国民やマーケットから高い信頼を得ていくためには、こうした制度面の整備にとどまることなく、日本銀行自身が、適切な政策・業務運営に向けて不断の努力を重ねていく必要があることはいうまでもありません。そうした観点から、日本銀行では、政策・業務運営のあり方について、幾つかの点で見直しを行うことを決め、本年春頃までを一つの目途として、作業の取りまとめを行うこととしております。

　その第１は、公定歩合や金融調節の運営など、金融政策の基本方針を決定する政策委員会の会合について、その開催を定例化することです。こうした定例化の目的は、政策決定のタイミングを巡る市場の無用の混乱を防止することにありますが、他方で政策変更の機動性を損なわないといった面にも配慮する必要があり、開催頻度などの具体策について、今後検討を進めていきたいと考えています。

　第２に、そうした定例化された金融政策決定会合については、政策決定過程の透明性を高める観点から、議事要旨の公開を行っていくこととし、その詳細について、今後具体的に検討していく方針です。

　第３は、金融機関に対する考査についてです。研究会の報告書では、業務内容の明確化の観点から、法律上の根拠規定を設けることが望ましいとされました。日本銀行の考査は、金融システムの安定や金融政策の適切な運営という、中央銀行固有の役割を果たしていくうえで必要不可欠の機能です。考査は、金融機関の協力を前提として行うものであり、法定化によっても基本的性格は何ら変わるものではありませんが、日本銀行としては、考査の内容について、金融市場の高度化、複雑化に十分対応していけるよう、改めて検討を深めていく方針です。

　第４に、本行の決済サービスの提供のあり方についてです。わが国の決済システムに内包するリスクの削減に一層努めることとし、既述のとおり、日本銀行当座預金の決済に関するいわゆるＲＴＧＳ化について、市場関係者との協議を開始したところです。

　第５に、日本銀行自身の業務・組織運営の効率化・合理化についても、一層の努力や工夫を重ねていく考えです。

　また、政策決定過程の透明性向上という点にも関連して、マーケットからの信認を確保していくためには、タイムリーに情報提供を行っていくことが求められています。こうした観点を踏まえ、日本銀行では、昨年１１月に、インターネット上にホームページを開設しました。幸い開始当初より好評を得て、これまでに多くの方からご利用頂いております。今後とも、情報通信技術の発達を踏まえて、情報の受信・発信両面での工夫を続けていく方針です。

　日銀法については、現在、金融制度調査会の場で、法改正のための具体的な検討作業が進められていますが、その際、中央銀行研究会報告書で示された「独立性」と「透明性」という２つの視点は、十分尊重されるものと考えています。

　日銀法は、わが国通貨・金融の基本法ともいうべきものであり、金融・経済の市場化、グローバル化が進展する状況の下で、そうした新しい時代の中央銀行に相応しい法律へ改正することができれば、きわめて意義深いことであると考えております。法改正に向けての検討作業が今後とも円滑に進められることを期待するとともに、私どもとしてもこれに積極的に貢献していく所存です。

むすびにかえて
　２１世紀の到来まであと４年を残すのみとなりました。新たな世紀を迎える前に、環境の変化を前向きに捉え、これまでの制度や慣行について抜本的な改革を進めようとする最近の動きは、高く評価できるものです。経済社会のグローバル化が進展する中で、わが国が２１世紀も強い国際競争力と魅力ある市場をもつ重要な国であり続けるためには、グローバルスタンダードに見合った経済構造の構築に向けて、所要の改革を早期かつ大胆に実行に移すことが不可欠の条件です。私どもとしましても、インフレなき持続的な経済成長の実現に向けてのたゆまぬ努力を続けることを通じ、日本経済の構造改革の実現を支援して参りたいと考えております。

"Jun. 14, 1996","Speech given by Yasuo Matsushita, Governor of the Bank of Japan, to the Japan National Press Club in Tokyo on June 14, 1996 (The Role of the Central Bank) ","Introduction
I am truly honored to be invited to address the Japan National Press Club.

Today, I would first like to discuss the recent economic situation and the Bank of Japan's views regarding monetary policy management. Then I would like to examine some issues concerning the institutional aspects of central banking, including the basic mission and role of the central bank and its status in a modern democratic society. As there has recently been much discussion on the revision of the Bank of Japan Law, I hope that today's talk will contribute to your understanding of central banking, which is fundamental to these discussions.

The Recent Economic Situation and Monetary Policy Management
The Domestic Economic Situation
Starting with the domestic economic situation, the Bank of Japan's current view is that a moderate economic recovery continues. I will not go into the details of the situation or the reasoning behind this view, as I spoke on these matters to your colleagues at a press conference only a few days ago. But I believe that most people will agree with the Bank's view that the recent developments in demand and production as well as the results of the Bank's May Tankan--Short-Term Economic Survey of Enterprises in Japan indicate that the Japanese economy is on a path of moderate recovery.

The question is whether this recovery trend will gather momentum and spread throughout the economy, thereby laying a firm foundation for a self-sustained economic recovery. To answer this question, I would like to discuss the major points to be considered with regard to the immediate developments in the economy.

One can think of two channels through which a self-sustained recovery led by private demand is generated. The first channel is a process in which improvements in corporate production and profits lead to a stronger and wider-ranging recovery of business fixed investment. At present, profits of large manufacturing firms are projected to increase in fiscal 1996 for the third consecutive year. Profitability itself has improved significantly, and the current profits-to-sales ratio is likely to exceed 4 percent this fiscal year. In past business cycles, this level of profits was achieved about one year after the recovery began, when the strength of the recovery was fairly well established. In the present recovery phase, however, it has taken more than two and a half years to reach that same level. This indicates how severe the difficulties accompanying the present economic recovery are, namely, the aftereffects of the bursting of the economic ""bubble,"" and the pressures exerted on the country's industrial structure for adjustment to the new international economic environment.

It appears that these difficulties were more severe for the non-manufacturing sector and for small and medium-sized firms. In fact, the improvement in their performance lagged far behind that of the large manufacturing firms. More recently, however, economic recovery has at last started to spread to the non-manufacturing sector and to the small and medium-sized firms. For example, large non-manufacturing firms, except for those in the construction industry, expect an increase in profits this fiscal year. In addition, small and medium-sized firms project a larger growth in profits than that of last fiscal year, although their level of profits remains low.

This spread of the recovery of business performance throughout the corporate sector is typically reflected in business fixed investment. Large firms in both the manufacturing and non-manufacturing sectors plan to expand their fixed investment this fiscal year, and small and medium-sized firms are gradually starting to follow this trend.

The second channel through which a self-sustained recovery is attained is where such recovery in business activity increases employees' income, thereby stimulating the consumption and housing investment of the household sector. In this respect, however, there has not been any major change in the basic trend of recent years, which has seen firms encumbered with excess labor and continuing to implement restructuring measures, including the reduction of labor costs. Therefore, compared with the first channel, the force of this second channel to generate a recovery still seems limited.

Yet, if we sketch out the developments since 1995, it is fair to say that with the recovery of the economy, the employment situation has finally bottomed out and is starting to improve, although at a very slow pace. Macroeconomic employment indicators in general are showing some improvement, and firms’ attitude toward employment is gradually becoming positive as reflected in the Tankan. Such changes in the employment situation also seem to have contributed to the recovery in consumer confidence and to the continuing high level of housing investment.

When considering the channels through which a self-sustained recovery can be achieved, it is the Bank’s view that the process whereby strengthened business activity leads to increased business fixed investment and to greater personal consumption is beginning to come into effect, and this process is gradually spreading to a wider range of industries and to smaller firms. In this regard, there is now a greater prospect of attaining a self-sustained recovery. Yet, to date, the pace of recovery in general remains moderate, constrained by the various adjustment pressures mentioned earlier. There are also other factors that call for due attention, such as (1) the question of whether the substantial reduction in the external surplus--that is, the declining trend in net exports--will continue and how it will affect the economy; (2) the implications of the easing market conditions of semiconductors, an industry which has been one of the main driving forces of the economy; and (3) developments in fiscal expenditures.

Monetary Policy Management
The Japanese economy is thus at the critical moment when its transition to a self-sustained recovery is at stake. At this juncture, the Bank of Japan will continue, in the management of monetary policy, to monitor monetary and economic developments closely, placing an emphasis on cementing the foundation for an economic recovery.

Let me now explain the Bank's interpretation of market interest rate developments in the context of monetary policy management with an emphasis on securing an economic recovery.

Although the Bank has maintained such a policy stance, long-term market rates have fluctuated rather widely since the beginning of 1996. The interest rate on government bonds with the longest remaining maturity, which had declined to 2.8 percent in autumn 1995, rose to 3.5 percent in February1996. After declining to 3.1 percent thereafter, it rose again somewhat after the release of the May Tankan results, and is now at around 3.2 percent.

Whenever long-term interest rates fluctuate like this, various comments and arguments are made to explain the movements. However, the Bank bears the following two points in mind in observing long-term interest rate developments.

The first is that the market is constantly seeking to settle at a reasonable interest rate level while assimilating the various information contained in a vast number of diverse transactions. Thus, it is necessary to focus on the relatively long-term trend of market developments, without being preoccupied with short-term fluctuations.

The second point concerns the reasonable interest rate level--in other words, what determines long-term interest rates. The level of long-term interest rates is determined based on the market participants' projection of the rate of return on investments or of the economic growth rate--in other words, their economic outlook. Also reflected in the interest rate level is the participants' projection of the Bank's monetary policy stance based on such economic outlook.

Since the autumn of 1995, the Bank has conducted money market operations in a manner designed to develop a stable market trend and to encourage a market-led formation of interest rates. Thus, the gradual rise in long-term interest rates since last year can be construed as reflecting the market’s assimilation of various information, particularly the market participants’ view that the economy is recovering gradually.

When I express such views on long-term interest rates, the media and the markets at times read too much between the lines. However, my aim is to encourage a natural market-led formation of market interest rates based on the economic fundamentals, which in turn enables the Bank to obtain greater information for assessing the economic situation. I very much count on your understanding of the policy and intentions of the Bank, since you are one of the important conduits between the Bank of Japan and the financial markets.

Issues Facing the Financial System
Another pressing issue for the Japanese economy, alongside securing a self-sustained recovery, is to restore domestic and international confidence in the financial system and to strengthen the financial functions so as to support economic activities.

As you are fully aware, bills concerning financial reforms, including those for establishing the jusen-resolution scheme, have been passed by the House of Representatives and are currently under deliberation in the House of Councilors. In addition to the bills for solving the jusen problem are bills to establish a comprehensive framework for encouraging an early solution of the nonperforming-asset problem as a whole--such as those bills for strengthening the functions of the Deposit Insurance Corporation and those for introducing a system for taking prompt corrective actions against troubled financial institutions. All these are therefore significant in restoring the soundness of the financial system.

However, installing the above-mentioned framework will not bring an end to the problems in the financial system. In addition to the early disposal of nonperforming assets, individual financial institutions will need to make further efforts to heighten their creditworthiness domestically and internationally by recovering impaired capital, improving public disclosure of financial conditions, and promoting restructuring of their businesses. Should a financial institution face liquidity problems in the process of such efforts, the Bank of Japan, as the central bank, will take the necessary measures to maintain the stability of the overall financial system and, at the same time, will encourage the financial institutions concerned to engage in more rigorous efforts.

Alongside the endeavors of individual financial institutions is another major task of reorganizing the Japanese financial system as a whole, including the system of financial administration. Increasing attention on the revision of the Bank of Japan Law is presumably attributable to this background development.

Issues Regarding the Institutional Aspect of Central Banking
I would now like to move onto the second subject of today's speech: institutional issues regarding central banking. The ruling coalition parties' project team published a report on financial administration reform on June 13. The report included the revision of the Bank of Japan Law as one of the important pillars of the reform and laid out the basic points at issue.

In response to rising interest in the revision of the law, the Bank has on occasion explained its fundamental views on central banking in order to gain the public's understanding. In doing so, however, I always feel that there are some aspects of central banking which people find hard to understand. Therefore, I would like to take some of these up today and elaborate on our view.

There are three major points to the issue of central banking: (1) the nature of central banking and the fundamental roles of the central bank; (2) the relationship between the government and the central bank--in other words, the independence of the central bank; and (3) relating to the second point, the status of the central bank in a democratic society.

As these points constitute the basis of any debate on central banking, I believe that a common understanding on them is a prerequisite for any deliberation on the revision of the Bank of Japan Law.

Before going into the details of the discussions in Japan, I would like to briefly mention the background to the heated discussions that have recently taken place outside Japan with regard to central banking, which have in fact led to legal amendments and institutional changes in several countries.

Three factors prompted such an active debate: (1) there was a need to establish a unified central bank among the member countries of the European Union as part of the move toward an integrated Europe; (2) the establishment of a modern central bank at the core of the financial system was considered to be an important task in the transition of former centrally planned economies to market economies; and (3) the experience of stagflation in the 1970s and of the bubble economy in the 1980s--which was a global phenomenon not limited to Japan--has renewed recognition that the central bank's objective of maintaining price stability was significant.

In the debates, the basics of central banking were seriously discussed: major outcomes were the provisions for the establishment of the European Central Bank included in the Maastricht Treaty, and the ensuing amendment of the central bank law in France and Italy. The European Central Bank is to be assigned the objective of maintaining price stability and is to be granted a high level of independence from European Community institutions and governments of member countries. The creation of this central bank through a political consensus has valuable implications for Japan. I have no time to go into the details, but I wish to emphasize that serious and constructive debate regarding central banking took place and that this led to a consensus being reached in Europe on the desirable nature of the central bank.

The Role of the Central Bank
I will now go on to the first point at issue concerning central banking, namely, the fundamental roles of the central bank.

The Bank of Japan is often characterized as having three roles: (1) the issuing bank; (2) the banks' bank; and (3) the government's bank. Of these, the most fundamental is its role as the issuing bank, that is, to issue currency such as banknotes.

That this should be considered the primary role is easily understood by looking back at the historical process through which the organization and system of the central bank were established.

Some central banks were established by the government, as in the case of the Bank of Japan, whereas others evolved from a private bank which, in the course of history, came to perform the functions of a central bank, as in the case of the Bank of England. In either case, the central bank was established to stabilize the currency system by concentrating the issuing function to a sole institution and making it responsible for the control of the currency.

In the case of Japan, currency was issued not only by the government but also by private banks in the early Meiji era in the latter half of the nineteenth century, and various kinds of currency were in circulation, including those issued during the preceding Edo era, which goes as far back as the seventeenth century. The currency system was thus in a height of confusion and a fall in the value of currency, or inflation, was accelerating. To resolve that situation, the Bank of Japan was established to create a stable currency system by acting as the sole issuer and controller of the currency, and through this, to lay the foundation for economic development. As this example illustrates, the inherent role of the central bank is to issue and control the currency--or one might say, to enable the people to use money confidently.

To this end, two requirements must be satisfied: first, the value of the currency must be stabilized--that is, price stability must be maintained; and second, circulation of money and the functioning of the mechanisms through which monetary transactions are processed--in other words, the settlement and financial systems--must be stable and efficient.

The mission of the central bank, therefore, is to fulfill these two requirements in order to preserve the soundness of the currency, and to thereby provide a solid foundation for sustainable economic growth and for an improved standard of living.

To fulfill this mission, the Bank of Japan carries out diverse operations. Foremost, in order to stabilize the currency value, that is, to achieve price stability, it manages the monetary aggregates in the economy and interest rates. This is the essence of monetary policy, and I believe this point needs no further elaboration.

It is also an important task for the Bank of Japan to make the yen more convenient to use and to thereby enable firms and households to confidently engage in daily transactions and funds settlements. For example, the Bank ensures every day that adequate money is supplied smoothly throughout the nation to meet the needs arising from transactions, and it also controls the physical quality of money to ensure the supply of banknotes of a high standard. While these tasks might not stand out, they are nevertheless important in upholding people's fundamental confidence in the currency.

Alongside cash settlement, a large part of the daily transactions of households and firms are settled by means of funds transfers and remittances between banks. In turn, banks' balances are settled across their accounts held with the Bank of Japan. In other words, the majority of transactions conducted throughout the country is eventually concentrated and settled at the Bank. As a result, the amount settled across the current accounts at the Bank totals more than 300 trillion per day. This means that an amount equivalent to approximately 70percent of Japan's annual GDP is transferred each day through the accounts at the Bank.

Therefore, the Bank is constantly working to improve the settlement system so that such transfers of funds are processed smoothly. For example, the Bank of Japan Financial Network System, or the BOJ-NET, is a computer network for processing interbank settlements via accounts at the Bank of Japan, and is the product of continuous efforts made by the Bank over the years to realize a more efficient and sophisticated settlement system.

While I have used such words as ""currency” and ""money"" to mean ""cash,"" such terms today are not limited to cash issued by the Bank of Japan. As mentioned earlier, most of the household payments of public utility charges and settlements between firms are made by transferring funds between bank accounts rather than by cash. This signifies that bank deposits function as money based on the assumption that such deposits maybe exchanged for cash at any time at equal value.

Money held in this form is termed ""deposit currency"" as opposed to ""cash currency,"" and the amount held as the former far exceeds that of the latter. The amount outstanding of monetary aggregates, as measured in Japan by M2+CDs, is approximately 550 trillion yen, of which more than500 trillion yen is in the form of deposit currency, while cash currency only accounts for about 40 trillion yen.

Such a currency system, as I have already mentioned, is built on the public's confidence that bank deposits can be exchanged for cash at any time. Japan's currency system is thus founded on two kinds of credibility: that of the cash currency issued by the central bank, and that of the deposit currency offered by private banks.

Therefore, in order for this currency system to function effectively as a whole, the stable functioning of the overall financial system is essential. As deposit currency is one of the liabilities of private banks, sound bank management established on the principle of self-responsibility is fundamental to maintaining its credibility. In addition, a safety net such as the Deposit Insurance Corporation is provided to uphold testability of the financial system by offering depositor protection. Furthermore, should a problem arise in any corner of the financial system with the risk of spreading throughout the entire system--that is, when there is a risk that erosion of confidence in the system might spread through a chain reaction--the central bank is to provide emergency liquidity assistance as deemed necessary to prevent a malfunction of the financial system and its serious negative impact on people's lives. The central bank's function to provide such liquidity is known as the ""lender of last resort.""

To perform this lender-of-last-resort function smoothly and expeditiously, the Bank must not only encourage the sound management of financial institutions, but must also fully recognize at all times whether there is excessive concentration of risks within the financial system, and whether the sequence of settlements between financial institutions is conducted smoothly. It is also extremely important in the context of monetary policy management to understand and predict how the Bank's policy changes will affect financial institutions' market behavior and how that influence will in turn spread through the system.

Such function of the Bank of reviewing the conditions of financial institutions is performed by means of regular on-site examinations and daily monitoring. These are also important operations for achieving the mission of the central bank.

Having outlined a few of the diverse operations of the Bank of Japan, I trust that you understand how they are all closely linked to the Bank's two objectives of maintaining price stability and ensuring financial system stability, and that these two objectives ultimately translate into the single objective of the appropriate control of the currency.

Relationship between the Central Bank and the Government
Next, I would like to explain why the authority to control the currency is assigned to the central bank in major industrialized countries.

The reason for this assignment, in short, is that the authority to control the currency, or managing monetary policy, can in the short term be used for a variety of purposes if one so intends, but if utilized inappropriately, will invariably cause pernicious problems for the country in the long term.

History abounds with instances of heedless increases in the money supply and excessive interest rate cuts aimed at securing low-cost funding for the government or at forcibly adjusting the foreign exchange rate. These instances were followed in many cases by the undermining of price stability, triggering substantial economic fluctuations, or by the impairing of fiscal prudence. Whichever was the result, the public was to pay the ultimate costs.

Such historical experiences led people to conclude that the distinct duty of maintaining the value of the currency should be entrusted to the central bank, which is impartial to the short-sighted interests of the times, and that the central bank's unbiased and professional judgment should be respected.

One of the reasons for granting independence to the central bank derives from the nature of the objective of maintaining the value of the currency, that this objective can be achieved only through detachment from short-sighted interests in order to build a foundation for people's lives and the country’s economic activity. This independence can be perceived as one of the ways devised for checking and balancing powers in a modern state.

The two basic principles governing the modern state are ""democracy"" and ""separation of powers."" These principles are equally fundamental to a presidential system and to a parliamentary system: in either system, the parliament and, in turn, the people decide on the best way to achieve separation of powers--or, the best system for checks and balances. It is not only the well-known separation of the three powers of legislation, administration, and jurisdiction which is founded on this concept of checks and balances: in modern states, the concept is reflected in various systems, such as the bicameral system of parliament or the establishment of independent administrative bodies in the executive. The granting of independence to the central bank, or having an independent central bank, is also one of the systems based upon this concept.

Independence is granted to the central bank in major industrialized countries, not only in countries having a presidential system but also in those adopting the parliamentary system. While the cabinet is held primarily accountable to the parliament on economic policies in general under the latter system, independence has nevertheless been attached to the central bank by the judgment of the parliament in such countries as Germany, Italy, and Spain.

Of course, major industrialized countries have at the same time devised measures to coordinate monetary policy and other economic policies. Under these measures, on the assumption that adequately managed monetary policy and other economic policies are unlikely to clash, and that these policies do not have widely different aims, the government and the central bank will do their utmost to fulfill their respective duties while fully embracing the concept of checks and balances. This given, a system for coordinating policy between the government and the central bank is also in place in case such coordination becomes necessary. For example, in Europe, a number of countries have recently adopted a system allowing the government to make policy requests to the decision-making body of the central bank or to attend the meetings of the central bank board to present its views.

Democracy and the Central Bank
Granting independence to the central bank, however, does not mean enabling it to manage monetary policy willfully outside the framework of modern parliamentary democracy.

Recent international debate over central banking, which I mentioned earlier, has highlighted the need to enhance public monitoring of the central bank through its reporting to the parliament together with the need to strengthen central bank independence. This is one of the basic points of central banking on which a consensus has been reached.

This view, in short, sees independence and accountability as indivisible. Since the word ""accountability” is not familiar to the Japanese, allow me to take a moment to describe it in some detail. The word ""accountability” is commonly translated into a Japanese word meaning ""responsibility. “However, this translation does not fully reflect the true meaning of the word.

The word ""accountability"" derives from ""account,"" which has such meanings as to count money or to explain. In other words, ""accountability “implies not simply responsibility but ""responsibility to explain properly.""

Unfortunately, there is no corresponding Japanese word. This may be an indication of the fact that the concept of this word was not recognized widely in Japan. Yet, it is an indispensable concept when discussing central bank independence.

The effects of monetary policy are transmitted through extremely complicated channels and they become visible only after a substantial period of time, in certain cases after several years. This necessitates that monetary policy be managed from a long-term perspective, and also complicates the debate over the responsibility for monetary policy.

In managing monetary policy, therefore, the central bank is mindful of the need to properly explain the contents, the objectives, and the fundamental thinking regarding its policy management. This makes it possible for the bank to later review its policy stance and objectives, and to thereby learn valuable lessons.

Such an approach can be considered a mechanism for encouraging the central bank to manage monetary policy adequately and responsibly, and in a way that makes policy management clearer to the public. Furthermore, such an attitude should foster a better mutual understanding between the government, the parliament, and the central bank regarding the economic situation and their respective policy management, and it should thus also contribute to achieving a higher level of consistency in the country’s economic policies.

Some people express the concern that increased independence of the central bank might turn it into an untethered kite. However, the basic thinking today on central banking is that by adopting the above approach, the central bank will be able to manage monetary policy adequately without being bound by short-sighted interests or external pressures, and without the danger of becoming a tether less kite. Many of the major industrialized countries actually employ such a mechanism in an attempt to harmonize central bank independence and democracy.

The Bank of Japan has made various efforts to improve its accountability for monetary policy management. For example, in 1995, we began to announce all significant changes in our market operations with a view to clarifying our thinking behind such changes and our immediate policy on the direction of money market rates. In addition, when changing the official discount rate, we have tried to provide in official statements a more detailed explanation than before on the Bank's economic outlook and the reasoning behind the policy change. Furthermore, from this year, we have upgraded the contents of the Policy Board’s monthly and annual reports to include details of the policy decisions by the Board and the thinking behind those decisions.

Yet we believe much remains to be done. We will continue to study possible ways to further promote the transparency of our policy management and to improve our accountability.

Conclusion
I have discussed today the Bank's basic thoughts on central banking, making reference to the recent debate in major industrialized countries on this issue. The issue centers on the appropriate status of the central bank in a modern democratic society and on the establishment of a mechanism that will encourage the central bank to adequately perform its inherent duties.

According to a report by a project team of the ruling coalition parties, a forum is to be established under the government for transparent and fair deliberations on the revision of the Bank of Japan Law. Concrete discussions on the issue are yet to be held. When deliberations are launched, it will be required that the fundamental thinking on central banking, which I have explained, be shared broadly and that the debate be founded firmly on that common understanding.

When such a forum is established, the Bank of Japan intends to contribute constructively to the discussions, and to that end will be pleased to benefit from any constructive comments or suggestions you might care to offer.

"Oct. 11, 1996","Speech given by Yasuo Matsushita, Governor of the Bank of Japan, to the Yomiuri International Economic Society in Tokyo on October 11, 1996 (Financial Innovation, Financial Market Globalization, and Monetary Policy Management) ","Introduction
I greatly appreciate this opportunity to address the Yomiuri International Economic Society.

Today, I would like to first discuss recent monetary and economic conditions in Japan and the Bank of Japan's monetary policy management. I shall then review the financial innovations that are developing rapidly worldwide, the globalization of financial markets driven by these innovations, and monetary policy management in this new environment. I wish to convey to you the basic thinking behind the Bank's monetary policy management through today's talk.

II. Recent Monetary and Economic Conditions and the Thinking Behind Monetary Policy Management
A. Recent Monetary and Economic Conditions
First, with regard to the domestic economic situation, the Bank of Japan's judgment is that a moderate economic recovery continues.

In terms of domestic final demand, public and housing investments have maintained high levels to date. Business fixed investment in fiscal 1996 is expected to surpass the previous year's level for the first time in five years, according to the Bank of Japan's August TANKAN Report (Short-Term Economic Survey of Enterprises in Japan). Personal consumption continues to recover moderately in general, although some monthly fluctuations have been seen due to weather conditions and the effects of food poisoning.

This recovery in business fixed investment and personal consumption is underpinned by (1) the upward trend in corporate sales and profits in a wider range of industries and in smaller firms than previously observed; and (2) the favorable change in firms' stance toward fixed investment and employment reflecting the improvement in profits. Thus, it can be said that the mechanism of a self-sustained recovery, in which revitalized business activity leads to increased business fixed investment and personal consumption, is at work.

At the same time, however, the pace of production growth has remained slow on average. The Bank's August TANKAN Report indicated that the pace of recovery in business confidence had decelerated somewhat.

One of the factors behind such development is the continuing need for inventory adjustment in certain sectors. The semiconductor industry, in particular, has been burdened with excess inventories as the global supply and demand conditions deteriorated following the increase in production by chip manufacturers in East Asian countries since the latter half of 1995. Some raw materials industries, such as iron, steel, pulp, and paper, have also had to slash the high levels of inventories resulting from an overestimation of demand at the end of 1995.

Another factor that has maintained the pace of economic recovery moderate is the substantial decline in net exports (exports in excess of imports). As I shall explain in more detail later, one reason for this is that an increasing portion of certain domestically produced consumer and capital goods are being replaced by imports, with the expansion of the supply capacity of other East Asian economies.

However, it is highly likely that the downward pressures arising from these two factors will gradually attenuate. More recent developments indicate that production cutbacks in the iron and steel industry have led to significant progress in inventory adjustment, producing a recovery of the market conditions for certain product items in this industry. In addition, the depreciating trend of the yen since last year has started to have an effect on both exports and imports, gradually slowing the pace of decline in net exports.

In the meantime, public-sector investment, which has maintained a high level, is expected to decrease gradually in the latter half of this fiscal year.

On balance, the mechanism I mentioned a moment ago, namely, a virtuous cycle toward recovery originating from an upturn in business fixed investment and personal consumption, must gain further strength in order to place the economy firmly on a self-sustained recovery path.

B. Monetary Policy Management
In the management of monetary policy, therefore, the Bank of Japan will for the time being continue to monitor economic developments closely, placing an emphasis on further strengthening the foundation for an economic recovery.

C. Effects of Monetary Easing
Since the reduction of the official discount rate in July 1991, the Bank has consistently pursued a policy of monetary easing. In September 1995, the Bank lowered the official discount rate to 0.5 percent, the lowest level ever, and also encouraged further declines in money market rates. These measures were taken to counter the possibility that excessive price declines would adversely affect the overall economy, and to thereby encourage business confidence and put the economy back on the path of a self-sustained recovery. For more than a year since then, the Bank has maintained the low levels of money market rates, and a moderate economic recovery has restarted.

Nevertheless, we have met with criticisms and inquiries regarding the prolonged low interest rate levels. I shall, therefore, respond to these questions, especially to those regarding the effects of low interest rates on the household sector. But first, I would like to explain three channels through which monetary easing stimulates the economy, and how the measures to date have been able to make use of these channels to help bolster the economy.

The first channel via which monetary easing can positively influence the economy is the direct stimulation of firms' investment demand by the improvement of the profitability of investment. Specifically, business fixed investment is to a large extent determined by the projected profitability of investment, which is assessed by comparing the expected earnings from the investment with concomitant interest payments. It seems that the expected returns on investment have recently recovered to a level that sufficiently exceeds firms' interest payments, due to the notable decline in interest rates, and that this improvement has underpinned the recovery in business fixed investment.

The lowering of interest rates has also had direct effects on housing investment, lower housing loan interest rates having boosted purchases of housing. Recent figures for new housing starts have reached as high as 1.6 million annually, after hitting bottom in the summer of 1995 at 1.3 million.

The second channel through which the economy may be stimulated by monetary easing is the strengthening of corporate and household confidence underlying their investment and consumption, by the underpinning of asset prices. The prices of stock, land, and other assets are, in theory, equal to the present value, the total future earnings expected to be achieved through the utilization of the assets discounted by interest rates. Lower interest rates, therefore, in theory serve to increase the present value or the prices of assets.

Although this theory may not always hold in practice due to frequent changes in the earnings outlook, stock prices, for example, have risen by approximately 50 percent since bottoming out in July 1995. In contrast, land prices, especially commercial land prices, are still on a declining trend reflecting the ongoing adjustment following the bursting of the economic ""bubble."" However, signs of change have begun to appear recently in the environment surrounding land prices, such as a rise in the office occupancy rate and a slower pace of decline in rents. It can be considered that the support for asset prices through monetary easing has prevented confidence of the corporate and household sectors from waning further and has, as a result, encouraged investment and consumption by these sectors.

The third channel through which the effects of monetary easing may be transmitted is the boosting of corporate profits by the reduction of firms' interest payments. This in turn can strengthen the investment demand of firms and underpin the demand for labor. Recent developments in corporate profits indicate that large manufacturing firms expect an increase for the third consecutive year. Their profitability has reached the level which was achieved in past business cycles when the strength of the recovery had become fairly well established. Profits of large non-manufacturing firms and small and medium-sized firms, whose business conditions were previously slow to improve, are also expected to show a steady recovery this fiscal year.

While the rigorous restructuring efforts by firms have contributed greatly to these improvements in profits, the reduction in interest payments brought about by the lower interest rates has also played a significant role. Reflecting the improvement in corporate profits and the gradual recovery of the overall economy, labor market conditions have also begun to improve recently.

Some argue that the third channel, via which monetary easing has helped to boost the economy through reduced interest payments of firms, has impaired the income of the household sector. It is certainly true that the net interest income of the household sector has decreased. However, the Bank currently places priority on realizing a self-sustained recovery through the permeation of the effects of monetary easing throughout the economy, so that every economic sector in the nation can benefit from the recovery. Specifically, if monetary policy boosts economic activity as a whole by revitalizing business activity, it will thereby benefit the household sector by increasing the number of people employed and employment income.

Looking at developments in the income of the household sector, interest income and interest payments have both declined during the five years since the beginning of monetary easing, and this has led to an approximately 8-trillion decrease in net interest income. Meanwhile, employment income of the household sector has increased by approximately 40 trillion Yen. For the household sector as a whole, therefore, there has been a reasonable increase in income during the five-year period I realize, however, that it is impossible to generalize from this data that every household is better off, since various types of households exist in terms of income sources. It pains me to think of the difficult situation faced by those households which depend largely on interest income.

Having said that, the effects of monetary easing are undoubtedly steadily penetrating the overall household sector through increased employment income. The recent gradual improvement in personal consumption is a reflection of this growth in household income. I would very much hope that you will understand that, through this mechanism, monetary easing underpins economic recovery and benefits the entire nation, including the household sector.

The Bank believes that monetary policy should be managed according to the prevailing condition of the economy as a whole. The Japanese economy today is at a crucial phase in its transition to a firm, self-sustained recovery. The Bank of Japan, therefore, is managing monetary policy with an emphasis on further strengthening the foundation for an economic recovery.

III. Financial Innovation, Financial Market Globalization, and Monetary Policy Management
A. Globalization of the Economy and the Significance of Deregulation
I would now like to move on to the main themes of today's speech; financial innovations, financial market globalization, and monetary policy management. Today, technological innovation and globalization are interacting and proceeding in both the real economy and the financial sector. Let me start with the developments in the real economy.

One of the features of the world economy in recent years is the further acceleration of economic globalization, particularly the strengthening of the relationship between the emerging economies and the industrialized countries. As an integral part of this globalization, the Japanese economy is strengthening its ties with the rapidly developing East Asian economies in terms of both trade and direct investment.

Another feature is the progress of a horizontal division of labor among various economies in the world, which is occurring with the intensified competition. Reflecting clearly this new international division of labor, a significant development in Japan's trade with other East Asian economies in recent years has been that exports of capital-intensive goods, such as electronic parts and office machinery, have been expanding rapidly, while imports of labor-intensive goods, such as household electric appliances and clothing, have been increasing significantly.

Another significant development reflecting this new international division of labor is the specialization by individual countries in one area of a specific industry, perhaps in one specific intermediate good or in one specific manufacturing process. A typical example is the computer-related industry. In this sector, there is currently a global production system in which East Asian countries other than Japan produce panels, keyboards, and semiconductors; Japan focuses on semiconductors and liquid crystal display parts; and the United States manufactures software and central processing units. The recent trade structure of Japan in which electronic equipment and electronic parts account for a large portion of both exports and imports reflects this international division of labor.

Certainly, this rapid economic globalization is largely attributable to the fast industrialization of the emerging economies, achieved through improved industrial infrastructures and transfers of technology from the industrialized countries. At the same time, the benefits of technological breakthroughs in information processing and communications industries cannot be overlooked. Such technological advances have enabled firms to allocate manufacturing processes or bases for inventory storage or sales in a number of countries, and to manage them optimally.

Economic globalization can therefore be defined as a process in which optimal allocation of resources is realized across borders reflecting technological innovations and increased international competition, thereby improving economic efficiency. Such economic globalization continues to proceed apace, contributing to further development of the world economy as a whole.

However, the trend of globalization has also placed adjustment pressures on Japan's industrial structure, spurring it to adapt to the new international division of labor.

For example, amid intense global competition, firms are searching throughout the world for the most favorable location for production in terms of cost, while working to preserve and improve product quality. An increasing number of Japanese manufacturers have been relocating their production bases outside Japan to other East Asian countries, where significant progress in industrialization has been seen, as part of their managerial efforts to survive competition.

Furthermore, a wider range of products and services have become exposed to severe international competition and, as a result, downward pressures have grown on domestic prices to narrow the existing price differentials between Japanese and overseas markets, inducing a ""price revolution"" in Japan. This trend has spread beyond the manufacturing sector to the non-manufacturing sector, whose prices had more or less been protected by regulations and various domestic business practices.

It is undeniable that such structural adjustment pressures have hampered the current economic recovery. However, the adjustment is indispensable for the Japanese economy to adapt to the changes in the world, and the resulting transformation of the industrial structure in Japan can be expected to produce further efficiency and renewed growth in the economy. It is of great importance, therefore, that the structural adjustment continue to be promoted to realize a more advanced industrial structure. Further, in order for the structural adjustment to proceed smoothly, it is necessary that a stable macroeconomic environment be maintained through the appropriate management of monetary and fiscal policies, and that the potential strength of the private sector be fully drawn out through drastic deregulation.

The recent rapid expansion of the mobile telecommunications market and increases in the business fixed investment of retailers in Japan followed deregulation in the telecommunications and retail sectors. As evidenced by these examples, I would like to emphasize once again that amid this economic globalization, effective deregulation has become increasingly important for the Japanese economy.

B. Significance of Financial Innovation and Financial Market Globalization
Propelled by such changes in the real economy, the financial markets are also undergoing globalization, and at an even faster pace. Here again, the major driving force has been the rapid progress in information processing and telecommunications technology.

An important aspect of financial business is exchanging transfer instructions for funds and securities and processing the trades on books. Another important aspect is gathering and analyzing information regarding the risks and returns associated with financial transactions (those arising from changes in the creditworthiness of the debtors or in the prices of assets) and also intermediating and underwriting such risks and returns. It can thus be said that financial business basically requires advanced techniques of data processing, and accordingly, benefits greatly from the progress in computer and network technology.

For example, in large-value funds settlement, electronic means have been widely used. Some new computerized methods are now being tested for small-value payments. One typical example is the recent trials of electronic money. These new developments in the area of payment and settlement could not have taken place had it not been for advances in telecommunication networks and computer technology.

Furthermore, new types of financial instruments such as derivatives and securitized products have grown rapidly in financial markets in recent years. These new instruments have been developed owing to progress in computer technology, which has facilitated statistical analysis and management of risks.

I would like to explain this development in a little more detail. Derivatives such as futures and options differ from bank loans, bonds, stocks, and other conventional financial instruments, in that certain elements, namely, credit risk, interest rate risk, and price risk, are separated from the underlying instruments, developed into individual financial products, and given a market life of their own. These elements can also be combined in various ways to meet the diverse needs of customers. For example, interest rate futures are a tool for transacting only the interest rate risk, detached from the credit risk of the original debtor. Conversely, credit derivatives carry only the risk of changes in the creditworthiness of the debtor, separated from the interest rate risks.

In general, these new financial instruments are perceived as extremely complex and difficult to deal in. However, as explained above, they are designed to carry one specific financial function, or a combination of functions based on different needs, making it much easier for investors and firms to select instruments that best suit their objectives, such as taking or hedging risks. In addition, derivatives can be easily standardized and can therefore be traded in a market with diverse participants. As a result, contracts such as currency futures and options as well as interest rate swaps are now traded 24 hours a day throughout the world, across borders.

The expansion of these new financial instruments has contributed to improving the efficiency of the financial markets as a whole, by heightening market liquidity through an increase in market participants and by facilitating arbitrage between different financial products. Such developments have also been strengthening the linkage between financial markets around the world, accelerating the global market integration.

According to a recent survey by the Bank for International Settlements (BIS), the notional amount of global over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives outstanding has reached approximately $48 trillion. The Japanese market today accounts for one sixth of the global transactions, a reflection of its integration into the global linkage. The fact that it has only been a decade since the emergence of derivatives was clearly recognized shows how fast the use of these new instruments has grown.

The progress of financial innovation thus promotes market efficiency. Therefore, it is essential that an environment in which the designing and trading of such innovative instruments are unrestricted be established for the further development of financial markets. Derivatives tend to remind people of notorious incidents in which massive losses were incurred. These, however, were strictly a problem of individual risk management. It should be remembered that, fundamentally, derivatives have provided diverse market participants with flexible and efficient means of hedging risks. The essential point is that each market participant must engage in transactions under appropriate risk management and that the development and trading of new financial products should not be impeded.

In the Japanese financial market, as I mentioned earlier, the turnover of derivatives contracts has already expanded to a substantial amount. However, the type of contracts lacks diversity, with the growth in OTC transactions being mainly in interest rate- and currency-related contracts. Transactions of securitized instruments have only just started to grow in Japan, and various institutional improvements are necessary for further development of these instruments.

In addition, these new types of financial instruments have the distinct feature of identifying and separating functions and risks involved in various financial transactions, unlike conventional financial instruments, such as bank deposits and loans, stocks, bonds, and insurance products, which are provided in each traditional segment of the industry. It will therefore also be necessary in the future to study the most appropriate institutional framework, including a review of the traditional segmentation of financial markets and businesses, to enhance the efficiency and stability of the Japanese financial market through the development of these new types of financial instruments.

C. Monetary Policy Management Amid Globalization
What are the implications of these financial innovations and the resulting progress in financial market globalization for monetary policy management? Before discussing these implications, let me first explain the Bank's views on the questions that are frequently raised, regarding the objectives and the effectiveness of monetary policy amid globalization.

One of those questions is whether central banks should strengthen international coordination of interest rate policy for the purpose of stabilizing foreign exchange rates, as interest rates now have a greater and more immediate influence on them.

As I have stated on various occasions before, the Bank holds the view that, while exchange rate fluctuations have significant impact on the domestic economy including prices, monetary policy should be managed appropriately with the aim of stabilizing prices based on an assessment of the overall condition of the domestic economy, which includes the effects of exchange rate fluctuations.

Placing too much emphasis on exchange rate stability in managing monetary policy is likely to undermine the foundations of domestic price stability and destabilize the economy, as proved by experiences since the shift to the floating exchange rate system. The instability of one nation's economy may in turn adversely affect the world economy as a whole. The larger the economy becomes, as in the case of Japan, the stronger the global effects of its instability grows. Therefore, monetary policy should essentially be focused on maintaining price stability in the country, and on thereby achieving sustainable economic growth. When economies are stabilized through price stability, exchange rates will also stabilize reflecting the economic fundamentals of the countries concerned. This reasoning has become commonly accepted by the G-7 and other industrialized countries.

Another question that we are often asked in relation to financial market globalization is whether it has become more difficult for central banks to conduct monetary policy autonomously, and whether domestic interest rates can be disrupted by shifts in the interest rates of other countries, as the effects of interest rate fluctuations in one country are easily transmitted to other countries through globalized financial markets.

The Bank believes that a central bank is able to guide money market rates in the country without being unduly affected by the interest rate developments occurring in other countries, and that the shorter the term of the market rate, the less the influence. This is because money market rates are influenced mainly by a central bank's stance toward money market operations rather than by expectations of short-term fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. The differentials between domestic and overseas short-term interest rates will vary according to movements in money market rates, but such changes will be absorbed essentially by the spread between the spot and forward foreign exchange rates. That being the case, there is no cause for concern regarding the central bank's autonomy in its monetary policy.

With regard to long-term interest rates, the real interest rates of various countries tend to converge over a long period, as arbitrage transactions between financial markets become more active. However, this requires that the exchange rates be determined based on the inflation differentials between those countries. As this precondition is satisfied only in the long run, such convergence of real long-term interest rates will only be seen in the long run.

Foreign exchange rates fluctuate in the short term, however, due to various factors such as the prevailing economic and interest rate conditions in individual countries. Long-term interest rates of a country in the short run will thus also shift almost independently of rates in other countries. Such short-run movements in long-term interest rates of a country will basically reflect the recent and prospective developments in the economy and in the interest rate reflecting the Bank's policy. It can be seen therefore that the extent to which short-term fluctuations in long-term interest rates in one country affect the rates of other countries is rather limited.

Thus, even with the ongoing financial market globalization, the autonomy of a country's monetary policy will not be restricted, and the degree to which movements in the long-term interest rates of other countries affect its domestic rates will not be significant.

From the Bank's views that I have just explained, you may have gained an impression that nothing has changed regarding monetary policy management as a result of financial market globalization. It is true that the objective of monetary policy remains unchanged, and there is little concern that the autonomy and the effectiveness of monetary policy will be diminished by the international linkages of interest rates. However, with the globalization of financial markets, the range of market participants in a country's financial markets has expanded beyond its borders and, as a result, the markets have grown extremely large and their efficiency has been improved. In the light of these changes, the elements that the central banks must take into consideration in order to ensure rapid permeation of the effects of monetary policy while ensuring market stability are definitely changing and expanding.

This is due to the greater role the expectations of market participants have come to play in the formation of interest rates and prices. Accordingly, an incident occurring in one corner of the world can now trigger immediate price adjustments across markets, as market participants throughout the world will instantly react based on the changes in their expectations. Especially with the growth of derivatives, there is now a greater tendency in the financial markets to react to various economic events by ""reading one step ahead."" In the context of economic policy management, this means that when there is a change in economic policy, the market will react by predicting not only the immediate effects but also subsequent policy developments.

In this new environment there is the advantage that policy effects can be transmitted instantaneously throughout the markets, so long as the markets have confidence in policy management. Conversely, if the markets do not have such confidence, even appropriate conduct of policy may not be able to convince markets to react in the direction intended by the policy authorities, due to the markets' anticipation that policy may once again be guided in the wrong direction in the future. Such a situation can be called ""the market's revolt.""

The economic policy of a country is under constant scrutiny by market participants throughout the world and, accordingly, monetary policy needs to be managed with full awareness of such market evaluation. What is most important in reinforcing the effectiveness of monetary policy under these circumstances is to retain market confidence in the central bank's ability to achieve price stability, the objective of monetary policy.

The Bank of Japan is making continuous efforts to retain market confidence in its policies in this regard.

The obvious precondition for retaining market confidence is to manage monetary policy appropriately at all times with the aim of stabilizing prices based on accurate judgment of the economic circumstances.

Let me further elaborate on this point. Prices in the industrialized countries have remained relatively stable since the beginning of the 1990s. It has been pointed out that this can be attributed to the increased imports of low-priced goods from the developing countries of Asia, Latin America, and former socialist economies. Some have even suggested that the malady of inflation has vanished in the industrialized economies due to this structural change in the world economy.

The inflow of such low-priced goods from abroad is indeed most likely having the effect of pushing down prices in the industrialized countries. However, it does not necessarily guarantee the stability of prices as a whole, since it is only the prices of relevant goods and services that decline. For example, if the economy of a country overheats and the domestic supply and demand conditions tighten as a result, inflow of low-priced goods will not be enough to counter the upward pressures on overall domestic prices.

Prices are ultimately determined over a somewhat longer term by macroeconomic conditions, such as the supply and demand in the economy as a whole, inflationary expectations, and the amount of money supply, and monetary policy plays an important role in controlling these conditions.

For example, in the United States, imports of low-priced intermediate goods from the emerging economies increased in the latter half of the 1980s. However, prices in general have been stable since then fundamentally because of the series of preemptive policy responses by the Federal Reserve rather than the increase in low-priced imports: the Federal Reserve succeeded in suppressing inflationary expectations by taking measures aimed at curbing potential pressures for a rise in prices induced by domestic economic expansion. Also in Europe, it has been the stringent monetary policy stance against inflation along with the efforts for fiscal consolidation, both implemented with a view to satisfying the Maastricht criteria, that have made the most significant contribution to stabilizing prices.

The Bank of Japan, too, intends to manage monetary policy appropriately with the aim of maintaining price stability, preventing inflation or deflation of domestic prices.

Another effort that is necessary in retaining market confidence is to improve the Bank's accountability in policy management by providing adequate and appropriate explanation of the Bank's economic outlook and its views behind its policy management. The Bank has provided detailed explanation in this regard at press conferences, in speeches, and at other similar opportunities. In addition, in 1995, the Bank began to announce publicly all significant changes in its policy stance on market operations and to clarify the views behind the changes. This year, the Bank made improvements in the monthly and annual reports of the Policy Board to offer more details on the Board's decisions and the thinking behind them. Furthermore, the Bank has started to release immediately information on daily monetary operations through commercial information vendors and also to publish press releases concerning policy changes, TANKAN Reports, and other data via computer networks and other means, to facilitate access by the public in general.

The Bank is by no means complacent and will continue to contemplate ways to further improve accountability by enhancing the transparency of policy decisions.

In addition to such efforts by the Bank, it is important that both the process of and the responsibilities for monetary policy decisions remain clear in the eyes of domestic and overseas market participants, in order for market confidence to be retained. When they assimilate information regarding monetary policy in Japan, domestic and overseas financial markets may react in a way totally unintended by the Bank, or may misunderstand the Bank's real intentions. The Bank believes that independence of the central bank regarding monetary policy management should be clearly established, so that the central bank will be able to respond flexibly to developments in the market and market confidence in policy management will be improved. This in turn will reduce the risk of the Bank's being misunderstood by the markets and will further accelerate the permeation of policy effects.

I would like to emphasize that this is what the Bank considers the true significance of central bank independence in the current financial and economic framework, when a review of the Bank of Japan Law is being deliberated by the Central Bank Study Group, an advisory panel to the Prime Minister.

IV. Conclusion
I have discussed today the background to the ongoing financial market globalization and monetary policy management amid such globalization. To summarize what I have said today, (1) even with the ongoing financial market globalization, the objective of monetary policy will continue to be domestic price stability; (2) however, market confidence in the central bank is becoming increasingly important to ensure rapid permeation of policy effects while maintaining market stability; (3) while the Bank itself will continue with its efforts in that direction, it is desirable that independence of the central bank concerning monetary policy be established; and (4) financial markets should be further improved to accommodate to the recent changes in the financial environment.

In addition to the above, central banks today face a fundamental need to strengthen cooperation with the monetary authorities of other countries to maintain the stability of the globalized financial systems. Today, I will only mention the need for such cooperation, as I have no time to go into details.

The Bank of Japan will continue to work on the various issues that I have discussed, and I would most appreciate your kind understanding and cooperation.

I am greatly honored to have been invited by the Research Institute of Japan to address this distinguished audience.

Today, I would first like to discuss the Bank of Japan's views on recent economic developments in Japan and the thinking behind the Bank's current monetary policy. Then, I would like to review some of the basic issues related to monetary policy management, such as the significance of price stability, which is the objective of monetary policy, and the points for consideration in achieving it.

There has been much debate since the beginning of this year about Japan’s central bank system, and the Central Bank Study Group, an advisory panel to the Prime Minister, is planning to publish a report in the near future. I myself have, on several occasions, addressed the basic issues involved, such as the status of the central bank within the framework of a democratic society, and the role of the central bank in maintaining financial system stability.1As my previous speeches focused on the institutional framework of central banking, there has not been an opportunity to discuss the Bank of Japan's views on the central bank's policy management.

For details, see previous speeches entitled ""The Role of the Central Bank"" and ""Recent Monetary and Economic Conditions and Issues Facing the Japanese Financial System"" given on June 14 and April 3, 1996, respectively. Both speeches are included in the August 1996 issue of the Bank of Japan Quarterly Bulletin.
I have thus selected monetary policy as the theme of today's speech. However, there is another reason. Over the past decade, it seems that a new thinking has been developing among the industrialized countries regarding monetary and fiscal policy management, or more broadly, the economic policy management of a country. This has prompted heated discussions in various countries in recent years on monetary policy and central banking, and this new thinking will be of great significance in contemplating the future framework of the Japanese economy. I would therefore like to examine the role of monetary policy, bearing in mind this new thinking on economic policy management.

II. Domestic Economic Conditions and Current Monetary Policy
A. Domestic Economic Conditions
I would like to begin by reviewing domestic economic conditions. In spring 1995, the recovery of the Japanese economy came to a pause and, at one time, there were even concerns about a deflationary spiral. In view of these economic developments, substantial monetary easing and large-scale fiscal policy measures were implemented. Since the beginning of this year, the economy has once again been on a recovery path, owing to the permeation of policy effects and the depreciation of the yen. The Bank currently judges that a moderate economic recovery continues, but there are concerns as to why the economy has not shown a recovery that is any stronger than ""moderate"" for nearly a year.

This slow recovery can be explained by the tug of war between the forces encouraging recovery and the structural adjustment pressures constraining recovery. Therefore, to predict future economic developments, we must first understand how these two factors are at work in the economy.

One of the forces encouraging recovery is the permeation of policy effects. For example, there is no doubt that the decline in interest rates has been contributing significantly to the recovery in housing and business fixed investments. At the same time, fiscal expenditures have underpinned domestic aggregate demand. However, forces encouraging economic recovery are not limited to the supporting policy measures. As the economy follows a recovery path supported by policy effects, a larger number of firms with improving profits have begun to show a more positive stance toward business fixed investment and employment. As a result, the risk of a deflationary spiral, which was an issue of concern last year, has been practically eliminated. It can thus be said that the cyclical forces of the economy based on domestic private demand have been slowly but steadily at work for the past year.

However, the factors that constrain economic recovery have also been persistent. For example, while business fixed investment continues to recover owing to progress in capital stock adjustment, it has not yet gained the full momentum seen in past economic recoveries. This is because firms, in spite of improved profits, have given priority to repaying debts in order to improve their balance sheets, or have limited their gross fixed investment to the amount of cash flow generated from depreciation of existing facilities.

Intensified competition with other Asian countries, which has brought changes to the international environment, is also affecting the Japanese economy in various ways. The inflow of low-priced goods from other Asian countries, for example, seriously affects firms producing competing products. Furthermore, the relocation of production bases overseas by Japanese manufacturers not only decreases domestic business fixed investment by those manufacturers, but also restrains the investment by their domestic subcontractors, due to decrease in orders. It seems that management of firms has not been able to dispel uncertainties over the future, as the path toward a new industrial structure remains obscure under the current circumstances.

B. Structural Adjustment Pressures
The Japanese economy is thus faced with two types of adjustment pressures: pressures for balance-sheet adjustment in the corporate sector; and pressures for structural adjustment of the industries created by the intensifying competition with other Asian countries. These are the factors that have caused the pace of economic recovery to remain moderate. These two adjustment pressures are, however, significantly different in nature.

Adjustment of balance sheets is about reducing debts which accumulated during the ""bubble"" period, in other words, disposing of the burdens from the past. To that extent, this adjustment is regrettably of a negative nature.

In order to reduce the burdens, it will be necessary to enhance the functions of the capital markets to strengthen firms' capital bases, and to revitalize the real estate market to facilitate the liquidation of firms' real estate holdings. Ultimately, however, it is only increase in profits that provides the funds necessary to write off latent losses on real estate and repay accumulated loans. In other words, the burdens from the past need to be reduced gradually with each year's income arising from economic activity.

In this regard, although it may sound paradoxical, revitalizing economic activity and boosting corporate profits, or more fundamentally, supporting the recovery of the economy will be important preconditions for the smooth progress of balance-sheet adjustment. Realizing a recovery of the economy encumbered with impaired balance sheets, therefore, requires a stronger policy support than otherwise. This is one of the reasons why the Bank has implemented substantial monetary easing measures to date.

As a result, the economy has resumed recovery, although moderate, and corporate profits have been increasing. Accordingly, balance sheets have also been improving gradually. Regarding debt servicing ability, the ratio of firms' long-term debts to cash flow has been declining slowly for the past two years, after rising rapidly during the “bubble"" period. It can be said that firms' balance sheets have, in general, begun to show steady improvement, although differences remain between individual sectors and firms.

While the balance-sheet adjustment is an attempt to recover from a negative situation, structural adjustment of the industries in response to a new global economic environment is essentially a positive challenge in that the restructuring process itself introduces the possibility of creating renewed economic development.

The increasing supply capacity of other East Asian economies and their transition to market economies have intensified competition facing Japan's labor-intensive sectors. At the same time, however, these factors have expanded markets and business opportunities for the Japanese economy. Therefore, if the Japanese economy can adapt itself successfully to this new international division of labor, these developments should bring significant benefits to the Japanese economy in the long run.

In fact, a careful look at the Japanese economy will reveal indications of such positive industrial restructuring. The change in Japan's trade structure is one example. Until a decade ago, the top five imports were mostly fuels and raw materials, usually crude oil, wood, petroleum products, coal, and natural gas, although the order varied from year to year. In 1995, however, while crude oil maintained its top position, the other four major imports were office machinery, electronic parts, automobiles, and wood. The share of manufactured goods in Japan's total imports has doubled from 30 to 60 percent over the decade. This change by itself would merely suggest that the manufacturing sector, which had long been Japan's mainstay, now faces severer competition with imported goods. What is notable is that the composition of exports has also changed significantly during the same period. Automobiles, ships, and household electric appliances such as television sets and radios used to appear at the top of the list of export items. In 1995, however, while automobiles stayed as the number one import, electronic parts, office machinery, automobile parts, and scientific and optical apparatus ranked second to fifth, indicating that capital goods and parts have replaced consumer durables.

As labor-intensive sectors such as the consumer durables industry grow in other East Asian economies, exports of labor-intensive products from Japan have been declining, while those of capital-intensive products with higher value added, such as capital goods and related parts, have been increasing. This is a typical illustration of the Japanese economy’s strong ability to adapt to changes in the global environment.

The emergence and expansion of new leading industries in Japan are also indications of industrial restructuring. The mobile telecommunications market, for example, has grown rapidly to a 3.5 trillion Yen market and the business fixed investment of this industry has expanded to almost 2 trillion Yen, which is equivalent to the sum of business fixed investment by the automobile and iron-and-steel industries. Furthermore, in these three years when economic recovery has been unable to obtain a firm footing, some industries achieved earnings growth comparable to or even exceeding that attained in the three years during the economic boom of the latter half of the 1980s: namely, the electrical and precision machinery industries, which have succeeded in adjusting to the new international division of labor; and the pulp and paper industry in the raw materials sector, which has been able to benefit from the increased volume of information processed and distributed in today's technological age.

I have so far emphasized the brighter side of the domestic economy with the hope of further encouraging the efforts of domestic industries, but reality is obviously not so simple. During periods of transition of industrial structure, the contrast between the bright and dark sides tends to become stronger. Focusing on the dark side, the mismatch between labor supply and demand has become greater, and restructuring burdens have been particularly heavy on small and medium-sized firms.

Looking back at the postwar period, the Japanese economy successfully underwent several major changes in the industrial structure and shifts in leading industries. There is no doubt that during the periods of transition, management of firms faced great uncertainties about the future, and that it was extremely difficult to accurately predict which would be the growth industries in the coming years. However, during the era of high economic growth, the rapid expansion of the economy absorbed the negative impact arising from the structural adjustment of the industries. The main difficulty that the current economy faces seems to lie not in the industrial restructuring itself, but in the fact that the current economic growth is not strong enough to provide a similar ""shock absorber"" effect.

For this reason the implementation of structural policy, such as deregulation, has become an urgent issue. In order to promote industrial restructuring, it is necessary to create new investment opportunities and to encourage unrestricted and creative business activity through deregulation. It is also important to increase labor mobility and facilitate land transactions.

C. Economic Outlook and Monetary Policy Management
In order for the Japanese economy to be put firmly on a self-sustained recovery path in the face of reduced fiscal support, it will be necessary for the structural adjustment to continue to progress and for the virtuous circle between production, income, and expenditure to gain further strength. In this respect, firms have been responding steadily to the structural adjustment pressures. The decline in net exports, which had been a dragon economic recovery, has been slowing recently. In addition, inventory adjustment, which has been under way in certain sectors since this spring, has virtually been completed in their on-and-steel industry.

In light of these facts, it is most likely that production will be further revitalized, strengthening the virtuous circle of the economy led by expanded private demand. However, this remains to be seen.

In view of this economic situation, the Bank will continue, in the management of current monetary policy, to monitor monetary and economic developments closely, placing emphasis on further strengthening the foundation for an economic recovery. And to repeat my earlier point, it is also important to carry out structural reforms including drastic deregulation. In this respect, I hope that the new administration will continue to exercise strong leadership.

III. New Thinking on Economic Policy Management
The industrialized countries today attach more importance to structural policies, such as the strengthening of the competitiveness of domestic industries and the improvement of market infrastructure. In addition, these countries are making steady efforts to promote fiscal consolidation, to reform their central bank systems, and more broadly, to review national economic policy management and its framework.

This common trend among the industrialized countries is closely related to the recent changes in the global economy. The collapse of the former socialist bloc, for example, demonstrated the superiority of a market economy over a government-controlled economy: that is, the superiority of a decentralized economy over a centrally-planned economy. In addition, the transition to a market economy and the progress of industrialization of these former socialist countries and the developing Asian countries has stimulated the industrialized countries to strengthen the competitiveness of their economies.

Furthermore, past experiences of economic fluctuations, such as inflation and the asset-price ""bubble,"" and the concurrent accumulation of budget deficits have prompted countries to closely re-examine the fundamental thinking on economic policy and the underlying economic theories. This year happens to be the 50th year since the death of John Maynard Keynes. There have recently been renewed discussions on the evaluating of Keynes' theories and Keynesian economics, which in many respects formed the basis of postwar economic policies.

The approaches currently adopted by various countries in addressing economic policies have several points in common.

The first point is the growing emphasis placed on improving the supply side of the economy. The conventional approach to economic policy emphasizes the control of aggregate demand through monetary and fiscal policies, and this remains dominant when seeking short-term adjustments of the economy. At the same time, however, there is a growing perception that the driving force of long-term economic growth owes much to firms’ efforts to improve their productivity. It is thus necessary to strengthen the supply side of the economy by promoting the introduction of new technology and by improving infrastructures such as transportation and telecommunications.

In fiscal policy management, greater importance is being attached to the details of fiscal expenditures from the viewpoint of evaluating the contribution of each portion to the improvement of economic infrastructures, rather than to their effects in generating additional demand. There is also a stronger awareness that, in the medium to long term, it is more desirable to curtail inefficient fiscal expenditures thereby reducing budget deficits and to utilize economic resources more efficiently in the private sector. All this reflects the growing emphasis on the supply side of the economy.

The second point in common in the approaches to addressing economic policies is the emphasis placed on the utilization of the market mechanism. Related to the first point, it can be said that this emphasis calls for fully utilizing the inherent forces of the market mechanism of promoting greater economic efficiency and of inducing technological innovation, in order to achieve higher productivity.

The global trend toward deregulation and promotion of market competition obviously originates in this common thinking. The effectiveness of the market mechanism is not limited to revitalization of industries and improvement of financial markets. For example, in Europe, there is a growing understanding that the main cause of the high unemployment rate, which has persisted for some time, is the lack of mobility in the labor markets. The solution to the problem, therefore, is considered to lie in facilitating the mobility in the labor markets so as to efficiently adjust labor market conditions.

The third common element is the growing emphasis placed on the public’s expectations regarding future developments and its confidence in economic policies. For example, the effectiveness of fiscal policy depends significantly on the public's views on the controllability of the fiscal deficits in the future. In the European countries and the United States, there is a growing perception that doubts about a government's ability to control budget deficits could bring about an unfavorable rise in long-term interest rates. This is one of the major reasons why fiscal consolidation is considered to be an important task.

It has also become clear that changes in expectations regarding price and interest rate developments significantly influence the effectiveness of monetary policy.

There is a theory which even suggests that discretionary economic policy would not have any effect if people always had rational expectations about the future. While this may be an extreme example, in general it has come to be considered that the efficacy of economic policy cannot be discussed without taking into account its effects on people’s expectations.

These recent changes in the thinking on economic policy naturally have a close bearing on the fundamental thinking about central banking and monetary policy management. For example, even when implementing short-term demand management policy, it is necessary to ensure that the policy is compatible with the objective of price stability -- the medium- to long-term objective of monetary policy and a precondition for the smooth functioning of the market mechanism. It is also necessary to ensure that the public’s confidence in monetary policy be strengthened by clearly establishing the independence and accountability of the central bank. Bearing these points in mind, I would now like to move on to the other theme of today's speech, the fundamental issues concerning monetary policy management.

IV. The Basic Thinking on Monetary Policy Management
A. Price Stability and the Central Bank
Most people agree that the objective of monetary policy is the maintenance of price stability. I would like to explain why it is that this particular economic policy objective, among others, is assigned to monetary policy.

Price stability, in this context, is not necessarily the stability of prices of individual goods and services, in other words, the stability of relative prices of individual items. In fact, fluctuation of relative prices in response to changes in the supply and demand conditions reflects the most basic principle of market mechanism. Central banks aim at achieving the stability of prices in general by taking the prices of individual items in their totality. If prices in general increase, that is, if inflation occurs, the amount of goods that can be purchased for 10,000 Yen will decrease, which means that the value of 10,000 Yen will decline. It can thus be said that ""prices in general"" is another way of expressing ""currency value."" The maintenance of price stability naturally becomes one of the most important missions of the central bank as the issuer of the currency, together with the mission of maintaining the stability of the financial system.

Moreover, in the long run, it is the monetary policy of the central bank that is able to most effectively achieve stability of prices in general. It is true that prices, in the short term, fluctuate due to various factors: overseas market prices, such as crude oil prices; or the supply and demand conditions of particular goods. However, from a longer-term perspective, prices in general are determined by the amount of money relative to the amount of traded goods and services. For this reason inflation is often said to be a monetary phenomenon, and the task of achieving price stability is necessarily assigned to monetary policy. This then explains why the monetary policy of the central bank is so vital and why the central bank is called the guardian of the currency.

There is a question of how asset prices, such as land prices and stock prices, maybe considered in the management of monetary policy. The Bank believes that it is unsuitable to consider asset prices in the same way as it does the prices of ordinary goods and services. For example, land is not produced by everyday economic activity. In addition, land prices are determined in part by the perception of earnings that will be generated from the land, in other words, by the projection of economic activity and prices. Asset prices are therefore different in nature from the prices of goods and services that are produced daily through economic activity and consumed. It is also apparent, however, from the bitter experiences of the ""bubble"" economy that major fluctuations in asset prices are related to large swings in the economy. Therefore, the Bank believes that in order to ensure price stability in the medium to long term, due attention must be paid to asset-price developments. Later, I would like to discuss in more detail the meaning of price stability in the medium to long term.

B. The Significance of Price Stability
Let me now consider the significance of price stability. It seems self-evident that inflation and deflation are not desirable. As large fluctuations in prices are usually accompanied by economic overheating or recession, the stabilization of prices will lead to a stable economy. Furthermore, price fluctuations lead to an uneven distribution of income and assets, thereby threatening the stability of people's everyday lives.

In addition to the above, I would like to stress that the stability of prices in general is the most important precondition for the smooth functioning of the market mechanism. The market mechanism adjusts production and demand according to the signals sent by the changes in relative prices. Once inflation or deflation occurs, it becomes extremely difficult to read the signals received from the changes in individual prices, and as a result, the price mechanism ceases to function properly. This is because it becomes impossible to distinguish whether changes in individual prices reflect shifts in relative prices or in prices in general. It is as if there is no reliable yardstick for economic activity. Under such circumstances, firms trying to formulate future business plans based on their estimation of profitability of investments, and households making plans for savings and consumption face growing uncertainties, and this impede economic development.

In the past, some argued that inflation is desirable to a certain extent in order to further stimulate economic growth, or that firms' activities would become more vigorous under inflation. The 50 years of postwar experience and the evolution of economic theories, however, have forced serious reconsideration of this argument. There is every likelihood that a mild inflation will eventually lead to full-scale inflation. In addition, once inflation takes root, the achievements of business activity are masked by nominal increases in profits, and accordingly, technological innovation and improvement in productivity are likely to be discouraged. Actual examples demonstrate that, from a longer-term perspective, countries with stable prices tend to enjoy higher economic growth.

For these reasons, the current emphasis is on the significance of price stability, which is in line with the global trend in economic policy management placing stronger emphasis on the supply side of the economy and on the utilization of the market mechanism.

C. The Meaning of Price Stability and Assessment Criteria
How can price stability be defined? This remains a difficult question as it is not easy to draw a line between acceptable and unacceptable rate of price increase.

In theory, zero inflation would be desirable. If prices are to be the yardstick for economic activity, zero inflation allows the yardstick to be reliable and unchanging, and in addition avoids the adverse effects of price fluctuations on income distribution.

I said that this is true ""in theory"" for several reasons. First, there are limitations to the accuracy of price statistics in that it is difficult to exclude price increases arising from improvements in product quality or to reflect changes in the market share of products. As the statistics become biased due to such technical limitations, some argue that it is undesirable to aim at zero inflation based on a specific price indicator. In addition, if there is a downward rigidity in certain prices and wages due to business practices and contractual constraints, the cost of achieving zero inflation could become substantial.

In view of the significance of price stability as discussed earlier, a more practical criterion would be the sustainability of price stability in the medium to long term. This is because prices serve as a yardstick not only for deciding current production and consumption, but also for deciding the activities that lead to future economic developments, such as business fixed investment and savings. The perception that prices influence future developments has led to an increasing tendency to view price stability as being the state in which firms and households need not consider prospective price fluctuations in their economic decision-making.

Even when price indexes remain stable during a certain period, price stability in the medium to long term could be at risk if the economy is overheating and creating potential upward pressures on prices. Monetary policy must thus be managed not only to minimize current fluctuations in prices, but also to contain the potential risk of price fluctuations in the future. This is why price stability is said to be a medium- to long-term objective of monetary policy.

The maintenance of price stability does not conflict with the achievement of stable economic growth and employment conditions. For example, measures to prevent overheating (or recession) of the economy can at the same time contain inflation (or avoid deflation), and provide medium- to long-term price stability; and this price stability, in turn, is a prerequisite for achieving sustainable growth of the economy, as I mentioned earlier.

D. Features of Monetary Policy
I would now like to examine the important elements in managing monetary policy.

There are two features of monetary policy that differentiate it from other economic policies. The first feature is that monetary policy uses market-oriented measures to transmit policy effects to market participants and therefore the efficacy of monetary policy depends on the market's reaction to the measures taken by the central bank. In this respect, monetary policy differs significantly in nature from the government's economic policy, which aims to achieve its objectives through administrative means such as laws and regulations.

Specifically, monetary policy affects the supply and demand of funds in the financial markets through the implementation of the Bank's daily operations, such as bill and bond transactions. The mechanism is initiated in changes made to the money market interest rates, or in technical terms, changes to the overnight rates in the interbank market, which can be referred to as the wholesale market for cash and reserves. Changes in these rates affect other short-term interest rates and longer-term rates through arbitrage in the markets, which in turn influence changes in the deposit and lending rates offered by banks. These changes in interest rates as a whole then influence the economic activities of the corporate and household sectors.

With the completion of the deregulation of interest rates, use of the market mechanism is currently the most effective way of transmitting policy effects throughout the financial markets and the economy. However, in order to effectively utilize this mechanism, public and market confidence in monetary policy is of decisive importance. Unless the policy intentions of the central bank are fully understood and considered to be credible, the effects of interest rate policies will not permeate adequately, and market interest rates may fluctuate independently of the intentions of the central bank, affected by unnecessary conjecture and rumors.

The second distinct feature of monetary policy is that considerable time is required before its effects materialize, in other words, there is a long time lag before policy effects permeate throughout the economy.

The mechanism through which changes in interest rates are transmitted to economic activity is complicated. Interest rate changes may have a relatively rapid influence on firms planning to make an investment in the near future. Theoretically, the effect of interest rate changes should be swiftly transmitted to fluctuation in asset prices.

On the other hand, it takes a considerable time for the effects of interest rate changes to appear in actual corporate profits and household income levels. One reason is that there are various types of borrowing and investment with short and long maturities. As new interest rates are applied to these instruments only at the time of maturity, considerable time is required before the overall interest rate level changes and before the new level takes effect throughout the economy. In addition, changes in corporate profits and income levels will only bring about a gradual change in the confidence of firms and households in their investment and consumption, and after some delay in time, new decisions will be made on investment and consumption. Further time is then needed before these decisions materialize as actual spending.

It has been said that preemptive policy responses are necessary to ensure price stability. This is because, as mentioned earlier, price stability must be achieved in the medium to long term, and because there will always be a considerable time lag before policy effects permeate throughout the economy. As this time lag in permeation of policy effects has become more widely recognized, greater emphasis has come to be placed in the management of monetary policy on assessing the potential risks in the economy, to enable preemptive policy responses.

E. Considerations in Monetary Policy Management
The requirements for monetary policy are thus ""maintenance of market confidence” and ""preemptive response."" It is, however, extremely difficult to achieve these two requirements simultaneously.

Let me explain how the two requirements conflict. In order to make timely policy responses, it will be necessary for the central bank to act based on its projections of the economic and price situations one or two years ahead. However, considering the difficulty of accurately predicting economic developments, such action may not necessarily result in market confidence in the Bank's policy. Nevertheless, it would be impossible to act preemptively if the Bank waited until a consensus was reached on future economic developments and desirable policy actions.

It is no exaggeration to say that the key to monetary policy management is in finding how these two requirements can be fulfilled simultaneously.

Central banks have tried to meet the two requirements through various techniques. For example, many central banks in the past adopted ""money supply targeting,"" in which monetary policy is aimed at achieving an intermediate target of money supply growth. This is a method based on the causality that fluctuations in money supply influence real economic activity with some time lag. However, it has been pointed out that financial innovations have made it difficult to discern the relationship between money supply and economic activity, and that although the relationship between the two is stable in the long term, it may be unsteady in the short term. Accordingly, many of the central banks which set a money supply target today mainly use it as a general guideline for monetary policy or refer to it as one of the major indicators in making policy decisions, rather than attempting to adhere rigidly to it.

Some central banks now adopt ""inflation targeting,"" in which a certain target range is set for inflation rate. This method aims to secure the confidence of the market by declaring beforehand the central bank's commitment to a specific target. For those central banks employing inflation targeting, another challenge besides setting the target range is devising how to take appropriate, individual policy actions under the price target. Countries with high inflation rates have succeeded in containing these rates by employing inflation targeting. However, the fact that the method has been effective in curbing a high inflation rate does not necessarily indicate that it will also be effective in sustaining already stable prices.

Recently, some academics in the United States have suggested evaluating the potential risks of price and economic fluctuations based on such concepts as the output gap and the expected inflation rate, and then utilizing these evaluations as guidelines in managing monetary policy.

Unfortunately, it is difficult to establish rules or other convenient guidelines which are by themselves sufficient to ensure optimal policy response. It is for this reason that the Bank of Japan has never adopted stringent targeting or specific rules to date, but instead, has consistently emphasized the judgment of the overall economic conditions and has made efforts to improve underlying research and analytical skills.

Learning from the bitter experiences of the emergence and the bursting of the” bubble"" economy, the Bank attaches utmost importance to realizing price stability and thereby economic stability in the long run, and, to this end, identifying and assessing the potential risks within the economy. The Bank has also been making increased efforts to explain its actions and policy in detail in order to gain the better understanding of the public.

One of the aims of last year's series of monetary easing measures was to eliminate the possibility of a deflationary spiral, in other words, a potential risk of excessive price declines. The Bank also made efforts to provide a clearer explanation of the details of policies implemented and the thinking behind these policies. Announcements on the Bank’s stance on money market operations and improvements in the monthly and annual reports of the Policy Board are results of these efforts.

The Bank intends to continue investigating ways of fulfilling simultaneously the two requirements of preemptive policy responses and of the maintenance of market confidence, by learning from theoretical and empirical studies and from the experiences of other central banks.

I would like to emphasize that, in order to maintain market confidence in the central bank which is an essential task for achieving price stability in the medium to long term, the institutional independence of the central bank becomes very important. Accordingly, it will be necessary to enhance the transparency of policy decisions and to establish a framework to ensure the Bank's accountability.

V. Conclusion
The review of the central bank system in Japan is likely to develop into a revision of the Bank of Japan Law after the Central Bank Study Group submits its report.

When seen from the vantage point of reconsidering the broad framework of economic policy, I believe that the revision of the Bank of Japan Law is significant not only to the Bank of Japan itself or to the financial sector, but also to the overall economy. Now that Japan's industries are making steady efforts to adapt to a new era, it is also required that the economic policy management of Japan be reformed to suit the times.

The Bank of Japan Law is to be reviewed as the first concrete step in the reform process of Japan's economic policy management. The law, stipulated in 1942, has been one of the rules and regulations constituting the basis of the old regime which has affected the country's economic policy management for the past 50 years. This is why much international attention is now focused on the reform of the central bank system in Japan.

In order for the central bank to achieve its missions, improvement of the institutional framework is necessary, but what is more important is that the Bank manages its policy and operations with due responsibility. We at the Bank are very conscious of this and will exert ourselves to the utmost to ensure that the Bank fulfills its responsibilities amid the ongoing globalization and shifts to market-oriented economies. I would like to conclude by expressing my hope for your continued support and understanding.

Thank you very much for your kind attention.",,Positive,0.8715369105,,
"Feb. 4, 1997","Speech given by Yasuo Matsushita, Governor of the Bank of Japan, to the Keizai (Economic) Culb in Tokyo on February 4,1997 (Recent Monetary and Economic Conditions in Japan)","Introduction
I truly appreciate this opportunity to address this distinguished audience at the invitation of the Keizai Club.

Over the past several years, the Japanese economy has had to overcome the aftereffects of the bursting of the economic ""bubble"" while facing the weighty challenge of establishing an economic structure suitable for the new era. Although there were concerns about a deflationary spiral at one time, the economy has been recovering moderately since the beginning of 1996 partly due to strong monetary and fiscal support. Recently, this economic recovery has gradually firmed, offering signs that progress has been made toward establishing this suitable economic structure.

However, since the beginning of the year, stock prices have fallen significantly, suggesting that market participants remain cautious about the economic outlook. With this in mind, I would like to discuss the Bank of Japan's thinking on the recent economic developments and monetary policy management, together with the Bank’s views on the uncertain factors regarding the economic outlook.

II. Domestic Economic Condition
With regard to the domestic economic condition, the Bank of Japan’s judgment is that a moderate economic recovery continues, and that the economic recovery is gradually becoming firmer.

When considering the strength of an economic recovery, the Bank pays attention to the positive interactions between production and private demand. Specifically, attention is given to whether the increase in production is leading to an expansion of business fixed investment through improved corporate profits, and whether this increased production is followed by a recovery in personal consumption through increased income.

Looking back on the economic developments in Japan over the past year from a viewpoint of determining the strength of the recovery, the growth of aggregate demand, including public and housing investments, accelerated in the first half of 1996,and accordingly, market expectations of an economic recovery strengthened and long-term interest rates showed a temporary rise. However, no significant improvement was seen in production, as the increase in final demand was partly offset by inventory adjustment and by an increase in imports. As a result, a virtuous circle of demand, production, and income was not confirmed.

This situation, however, appears to have changed somewhat in the latter half of 1996. Firstly, the decline in external demand, which had been a constraining factor of the economic recovery, halted in autumn 1996, mainly due to the increase in exports that followed a depreciation of the yen. Recently, there has been an upward trend in external demand. In addition, inventory adjustment in some raw materials and semiconductor industries was almost completed. As a result, production, which had remained sluggish in the first half of 1996, started to grow at an accelerating pace, reflecting fully the increase in final demand.

Notably, the firm recovery in production is now generating a recovery in private demand, including business fixed investment and personal consumption. Reflecting improvements in corporate sales and profits, recovery in business fixed investment is spreading to a wider range of industries and to smaller firms than previously observed. Indeed, according to the results of the November 1996""TANKAN -- Short-Term Economic Survey of Enterprises in Japan,"" business fixed investment for the smaller firms, which had been slow to improve, is expected to show a year-to-year increase in fiscal 1996 for the first time in five years.

Growth of personal consumption, the other mainstay of private demand, leveled off at one time in summer 1996, but resumed later in autumn, especially in consumer durables such as automobiles. The contributing factor to the moderate but steady recovery in personal consumption has been the improved income reflecting the favorable changes in employment conditions and wages that followed the increase in production.

It must be borne in mind that increase in demand ahead of the rise in the consumption tax rate scheduled for fiscal 1997 is contributing to the improvement in economic indicators, as in housing investment, and therefore, these improvements need to be seen in this light. There has, however, recently been a notable change in economic developments compared to the first half of 1996. Despite a gradual decrease in public-sector investment from the latter half of 1996, the virtuous circle -- in which increased production leads to increased private demand through improved corporate profits and employment income -- has clearly begun to operate.

III. Uncertain Factors Regarding the Economic Outlook
A. Views of Financial Market Participants
Turning from the Bank of Japan's views on the current domestic economy, the issue of concern now is the future development of the economy. Revitalization of economic activity usually brings about increases in corporate profits and employment income, which lead to improvement in business fixed investment and personal consumption. These improvements in turn lead to further expansion in economic activity.

However, developments in financial markets, such as stock prices and long-term interest rates, suggest that despite the increasing strength of the economic recovery, market participants remain cautious about the economic outlook. Various causes are cited for the significant fall in stock prices since the beginning of the year: renewed concern about the nonperforming-loan problem; uncertainty over the social and economic systems in Japan as a whole; and pressures to decrease the differential between domestic and international stock prices in terms of various measures of evaluation, such as the price earnings ratio. It is extremely difficult to assess each factor and to specify the cause of the uncertainty. Still, the overall trend in the financial markets over the past several months clearly indicates that market participants have a cautious outlook on the economy, as shown by the slowdown in growth or even a decline in stock prices since autumn 1996, and by the concurrent decline in long-term interest rates.

Cautiousness on the part of the market participants reflects the fact that they are strongly aware of the following three issues: (1) effects of the anticipated fiscal tightening in the next fiscal year; (2) structural adjustment pressures facing the Japanese industries; and (3) balance-sheet adjustment of firms and the nonperforming-loan problem of financial institutions, both of which are burdens created by the economic “bubble"" and its burst.

Before explaining the Bank of Japan's views on these issues, I would like to emphasize that my talk today is not intended to draw specific conclusions or to assess the levels of stock prices and interest rates. This requires careful analysis and is an issue on which a central bank governor should refrain from comment. Rather, I would like to give you an idea of how the Bank examines these issues.

B. Effects of Fiscal Tightening
The first issue that I would like to discuss is the influence of fiscal tightening -- such as reduction in public-sector investment, rise in the consumption tax rate, and termination of special tax reduction -- on the economy for the next fiscal year.

Public-sector investment began to decline in autumn 1996, after having continued to expand until mid-1996 as a result of the economic measures introduced in autumn 1995. Although there may be a slight temporary increase in public-sector investment reflecting the implementation of the supplementary budget for the current fiscal year, the declining trend is expected to continue for some time. In addition, an increase in the consumption tax rate and the termination of special tax reduction is scheduled for fiscal 1997.

It is important to mention here that the influence of fiscal tightening on the economy may vary significantly depending on the prevailing economic conditions, such as corporate profits and employment income development, as well as on the confidence that the corporate and household sectors have in the economy. Furthermore, this influence can differ substantially depending on how the public's expectations of the future economy change in response to reduced fiscal expenditures and tax increases, and how market interest rates respond to any reduction in the budget deficit.

The effects on the economy of a reduction of public-sector investment or a budget deficit have been debated by academics. The simplest Keynesian view is that reduced public-sector investment cumulatively acts to restrain private demand through multiplier effects. Some argue that a decrease in the budget deficit will lower interest rates and the yen's foreign exchange value, thus offsetting the negative effects on the economy. Some even hold that because the public behave rationally with anticipation of future tax increases or reductions, neither a decrease nor an increase in the budget deficit will have any effect on the economy.

The influence of a reduced budget deficit on the economy may thus be complex and diverse, once the movement of market interest rates, foreign exchange rates, and the public's expectations are taken into account. It is natural to assume that in reality, the impact of reduced fiscal expenditures on the economy cannot be denied, although the influence is unlikely to reach the extent estimated by simply multiplying the nominal value of the reduction by a multiplier.

To underline the argument I just made, the economic mechanism does not work on the basis of simple addition and subtraction, but rather involves dynamic interactions of many factors which incorporates the public's expectations. After all, the effects of fiscal tightening are an empirical issue for which conclusions cannot be reached in advance, and therefore, it is very difficult to accurately predict future developments at this stage. Bearing this in mind, it is necessary to view carefully the effects of fiscal tightening on the economy as a whole.

C. Progress in Structural Adjustment of Industries
Let me now turn to the next issue of structural adjustment of industries, which is a medium- to long-term issue for the Japanese economy.

One of the changes in the environment surrounding the Japanese economy in the past several years has been that a wider range of industries have come to face severe international competition due to the increasing supply capacity of other East Asian countries. Weakening of international competitiveness made it difficult for some industries and firms to continue domestic production of some of their conventional products. This forced them to relocate their production bases overseas while shifting their domestic production to new products for which they have a comparative advantage.

This is not the first time that the Japanese economy has faced structural adjustment pressures. In fact, it successfully confronted the challenge several times in the past. However, the adjustment this time has inevitably involved greater pains than in the past, due to the aftereffects of the bursting of the economic ""bubble.""

Furthermore, as relocation overseas took place prior to a shift to new products, structural adjustment significantly constrained domestic production and, as a result, investment and employment were also limited. The negative impact was particularly substantial for the smaller firms, as many of them manufactured labor-intensive products and were subcontractors to the large firms which relocated their production bases overseas.

The key factors we should keep in mind in projecting future developments in the Japanese economy are therefore the progress in structural adjustment of industries, that is, the emergence of new products or industries that will promote future economic growth.

A careful look at individual industries reveals some positive signs. In production, for example, an increasing number of firms and industries are shifting to goods with international competitiveness. More specifically, production of producer goods and capital goods that are capital-intensive and technology-intensive has been increasing while production of labor-intensive consumer goods has been declining. These changes are also reflected in imports and exports of goods. Recently, exports of consumer goods, mainly household electric appliances such as television sets and radios, have been decreasing while their imports have been increasing, and exports of capital goods and parts such as electronic machinery and automobile parts have been increasing significantly.

Notable as these changes may be, one cannot simply add up these microeconomic developments to obtain a comprehensive evaluation of how successfully the Japanese economy as a whole is undergoing structural adjustment of industries. Rather, the progress in structural adjustment should be reflected most evidently in the revitalization of forward-looking business activity. If this were the case, the stance taken by firms toward fixed investment and employment should provide a measure of the progress in macroeconomic structural adjustment.

In this respect, business fixed investment by large firms began to recover in fiscal 1995 well ahead of small and medium-sized firms. Investment by smaller firms, which had been more susceptible to the structural adjustment pressures, has also finally begun to show recovery. Although the recovery is extremely moderate, this resumption of investment by smaller firms, an activity that lays the foundation for the future, may be considered as evidence of progress in structural adjustment as it indicates that these firms are starting to have a clear idea about the new direction of their business.

Progress is also reflected in business fixed investment of various industries. Namely, investment has been increasing in capital- and production-goods related sectors, where high growth in production has been recorded. There has also been a rapid expansion of investment in a new industry of mobile telecommunications. Business fixed investment for development of new products and new businesses also seems to be increasing gradually.

With regard to employment, structural adjustment pressures are persistent in some indicators such as the high unemployment rate. However, based on the most recent changes in employment indicators and the microeconomic information on firms, labor market conditions are seen to be improving gradually, indicating steady progress in industrial restructuring.

For example, recent numbers of new job offers are significantly higher than those in the previous year. Business surveys indicate that an increasing number of firms plan, for the first time in many years, to increase the number of new graduates hired in the next fiscal year. Results of the November TANKAN also indicate that more than half of the smaller firms surveyed feel that they are shorthanded. Furthermore, labor market conditions in each sector indicate that employment has decreased significantly in sectors where imports have been making inroads -- such as the electrical machinery and textiles industries -- while employment has increased in new sectors such as telecommunications. These changes indicate a gradual shift of labor between sectors.

In sum, although pressures for structural adjustment of industries remain, it can be said that structural adjustment has progressed significantly as reflected in the recent recovery in business fixed investment and employment.

D. Balance-Sheet Adjustment
The third issue to be discussed is that of balance-sheet adjustment. There are two aspects to this issue: the improvement of the financial condition of firms and the disposal of nonperforming loans of financial institutions.

With regard to balance-sheet adjustment of Japanese firms, there have been serious efforts by firms to reduce their liabilities since the bursting of the economic” bubble."" Despite these efforts, the mismatch between assets and liabilities expanded in many sectors until 1994 or 1995 due to the continued decline in real estate prices. While the decline in asset prices has slowed since 1995, liabilities have decreased owing to the recovery in corporate profits which followed firms' restructuring efforts and lower interest rates.

Several indicators, such as the ratio of long-term debts to assets at market value, reveal that balance-sheet adjustment pressures are persistent. In particular, small and medium-sized firms still need to make substantial efforts to complete their adjustment. As I have just mentioned, however, the improvement of firms' balance sheets has doubtlessly been making moderate but steady progress in general, and thus, constraints imposed by the adjustment pressures on economic recovery should continue to be gradually alleviated.

Regarding the nonperforming-loan problem of financial institutions, the total amount of nonperforming loans of the financial institutions was approximately 29 trillion yen as of the end of September 1996, according to the data published by the Ministry of Finance. Of this total, the estimated amount of problem loans to be disposed of, not including those already covered by collateral and provisions, is estimated at approximately 7 trillion yen. Both of these figures have decreased by approximately 10 trillion yen from the previous year, and thus, in general, it can be said that steady progress has been made in solving this particular problem.

The amount of nonperforming loans that need to be disposed of, however, remains large. The Bank of Japan will continue to strongly encourage financial institutions to dispose of the remaining nonperforming loans expeditiously and to exert themselves to the utmost to (1) restore their capital bases which have been impaired in the process of disposing of nonperforming loans; (2) strengthen their profitability through restructuring; and (3) enhance their internal risk management.

In relation to the economy, an issue of concern is whether the decline in the intermediary functions of those financial institutions burdened with nonperforming loans is constraining the economic recovery. While it may certainly be true that financial institutions have imposed stricter screening criteria for lending following the experiences of the economic ""bubble"" period, most financial institutions now maintain a policy of actively increasing loans of reliable quality while, or rather for the purpose of, disposing of nonperforming loans. In fact, the lending attitude of financial institutions, as seen from the point of view of the firms, has become less severe and lending rates have stayed at a historically low level. It is, therefore, difficult to assume that the severer lending attitude of the financial institutions is hampering the recovery in business fixed investment.

IV. Economic Outlook and Monetary Policy Management
A. Economic Outlook
I have so far discussed such issues as the effects of fiscal tightening and the current situation of structural adjustment, both considered to be the major factors contributing to the cautious economic outlook in financial markets. Among these, developments of structural adjustment may be summarized as follows: (1) both structural adjustment of industries and balance-sheet adjustment are still in progress and therefore the pace of economic recovery is likely to remain moderate for some time;(2) however, as industrial restructuring and balance-sheet adjustment are making steady progress, albeit moderate, its constraining effects on economic recovery are likely to gradually ease.

Therefore, the most important issue in considering the economic outlook is whether the increase in private demand can overcome the downward pressures from fiscal tightening and whether it is possible, as a result, to lead the economy on to a path of self-sustained recovery.

As I mentioned earlier, the economic recovery has been recently gaining strength. If this recovery is analyzed in terms of the level of economic activity, namely the output gap, it can be noted that capacity utilization has been rising steadily reflecting the recent recovery in production, and has recovered to the same level as that of four years ago. Furthermore, the results of the November TANKAN indicated that the excessive production capacity and employment perceived by surveyed firms have gradually reduced to the same level as in 1987, at which time the economy was recovering from the recession caused by the appreciation of the yen. While the profit-to-sales ratio of smaller firms has not yet recovered to the average level of the past, the ratio of large firms has already reached a relatively high level. Judging overall, it can be said that the current level of economic activity in Japan is approaching the same point where the strength of the recovery began to firm in past business cycles.

This level of economic activity will provide a basis for the virtuous circle of the economy, one that is led by expanded private demand, to gain further strength. In other words, if the recent economic recovery continues for some time, increased production will further improve corporate profits and employment income, which in turn are likely to lead to increases in business fixed investment and personal consumption. If this virtuous circle gains stronger momentum, there will be a higher possibility of the strengthened virtuous circle absorbing the downward pressures from prospective fiscal tightening.

A temporary slowdown in economic recovery seems inevitable as downward pressures from fiscal tightening will be strong during the first half of fiscal 1997 and as reaction to the increase in demand ahead of the rise in the consumption tax rate scheduled for April 1997 is expected. However, the recovery trend of the economy is likely to be sustained on account of the strengthening recovery in private demand.

I indicated earlier, however, that it is necessary to consider the effects of fiscal tightening carefully. Business sentiment and consumer confidence also become important factors for a further increase in private demand. The corporate and household sectors will plan their activities and put them into action in the form of production, investment, and consumption, taking into account the fiscal 1997 budget and the actual placement of public work orders. Therefore, in predicting future economic developments, it is important to closely examine various macro- and micro-economic data: not only the economic indicators that will be released in the future, but also firms’ business plans and signals sent by financial markets.

Meanwhile, it is expected that prices will cease to decline due firstly to the rise in import prices reflecting the yen's depreciation and higher crude oil prices, and secondly to the improvement in domestic supply and demand conditions. However, when considering the fact that improvement in supply and demand conditions is expected to be moderate for now and that the pressures of global competition persist, there is only a limited possibility that domestic prices will follow a clear upward trend. Yet, as foreign exchange rates have recently shown rather rapid movements, it is necessary to cautiously monitor the effects of such a development on the domestic economy.

While refraining from making any comments on the recent foreign exchange rate levels and movements, the Bank's fundamental thinking is that it is desirable for exchange rates to be stable and determined in accordance with the real economic conditions of each country. Based on this thinking, the Bank of Japan will continue to carefully monitor foreign exchange rate developments and their effects on the Japanese economy.

B. Monetary Policy Management
In the management of current monetary policy, the Bank of Japan will continue to monitor economic developments closely, placing emphasis on further strengthening the foundation of an economic recovery.

In April 1997, the consumption tax rate will be raised from 3 percent to 5percent. Therefore, I would also like to discuss how the Bank of Japan views the possible effects of this tax rate rise on prices, in the context of managing monetary policy. Specifically, the issue here is what monetary policy measures should be taken in light of the price hikes due to the rise in the tax rate.

I would first like to point out that the price hikes caused by the rise in the consumption tax rate is different in nature from the ordinary rise in prices, that is inflation. Generally, inflation is generated in the mechanism of economic cycles as a result of, for example, tightening of supply and demand conditions for labor or products, or excessive supply of money. In turn, inflation affects economic activity in various ways.

In contrast, price hikes due to a rise in the consumption tax rate are equivalent to a once only rewriting of all the old price tags on April 1. There are no relevant changes in economic activity, such as tightening of supply and demand conditions, increase in wages, or excessive money supply. Therefore, it would not be appropriate to formulate monetary policy against such superficial changes in prices.

Although this represents the fundamental thinking of the Bank, it does not mean that the central bank is indifferent to the rise in the consumption tax rate. If the rise triggers price hikes taking advantage of the tax rate rise, or if the overall inflationary expectations are heightened, then the risk of a genuine inflation will arise. In particular, this risk cannot be disregarded when the supply and demand conditions for products are fairly tight. Therefore, it is necessary to pay attention to the inflationary expectations and possible over-reactions caused by the rise in the consumption tax rate rather than paying attention to the previously-mentioned superficial hikes in prices.

In summary, in order to promote smooth structural adjustment, to bring about a strengthening of the economic recovery, and to encourage renewed development of the Japanese economy, the implementation of a drastic structural reform, including effective deregulation, is indispensable. In this respect, I hope that the government will continue to exercise strong leadership and earnest efforts will continue to be made by various parties.

V. Financial System Reform and Revision of the Bank of Japan Law
A. Financial System Reform
I would like to use the remaining time to discuss financial system reform and the revision of the Bank of Japan Law.

The important challenge for Japan today is to vigorously promote structural reform as discussed above, and this also applies to the reform of the financial markets and of the financial system.

Financial markets worldwide have experienced significant changes in recent years amid rapid financial and economic globalization and technological innovation. New financial instruments such as derivatives and securitized products have been developed in succession to provide firms and households with diverse means of risk-hedging, investment, and financing. At the same time, profit opportunities for financial institutions have expanded in various fields.

It seems that it is now time for the market participants to select the market, rather than the markets selecting the participants. Countries are vying with each other to reform their financial markets, based on a growing worldwide perception that the financial services sector will show rapid growth and create numerous employment opportunities into the twenty-first century. Each country is thus striving to make their own markets attractive to participants.

Japan, too, has engaged in the review of regulations and systems to promote financial deregulation. However, reform has been gradual and financial institutions have tended to deal with it cautiously due to the severe challenge they have had to face after the bursting of the economic ""bubble."" As a result, the Tokyo market has fallen far behind the New York and London markets in terms of its ability to develop financial instruments that incorporate new techniques.

In recognition of this, Prime Minister Hashimoto proposed the ""Big Bang” deregulation package for Japan. I understand that the purpose of this financial reform package is to revitalize the Tokyo market as a free and active global market. The Bank believes that the aims of this reform package are most appropriate and as a central bank, intends to contribute to the achievement of its goals.

In carrying out the reform, it is especially important that the three basic principles of freedom, fairness, and globalization are strictly followed, and that the pace of the reform is not relaxed. The ""Big Bang"" package aims to realize and complete all reforms by the year 2001, immediately implementing any measures on which study has been concluded. However, this should not mean that the process of market reform become unduly gradual or slow, as this may jeopardize the consistency of the reform, or result in only an easier part of the reform being implemented.

For example, one deregulation measure included in the ""Big Bang"" package and highly valued by the Bank is the fundamental revision of the Foreign Exchange Control Law. If deregulation in other areas proceeds too slowly, the effects of the new Foreign Exchange Control Law might encourage financial transactions to shift to overseas markets and might then lead to the hollowing-out of the Tokyo market. In order to avoid such a turn of events, it is most important to bring about concrete measures within the shortest possible time to maintain the coherence of the deregulation as a whole.

B. Revision of the Bank of Japan Law
Lastly, I would like to discuss the revision of the Bank of Japan Law.

Revision of the Bank of Japan Law is now in the final stage of deliberation byte Financial System Research Council, an advisory committee to the Minister of Finance, following discussions last year by the Central Bank Study Group, an advisory panel to the Prime Minister.

The Bank has made public its views on the Bank of Japan Law revision at a press conference held at the end of 1996 and on other occasions. To summarize, (1)the Bank holds that the basic views stated by the Central Bank Study Group -- that is, ensuring central bank independence and enhancing transparency -- should be clearly stated in the law; and (2) the Bank believes that further deliberations should be conducted on several issues regarding the relationship between the government and the central bank, on which the Central Bank Study Group was unable to reach conclusions, so as to duly reflect the two concepts of independence and transparency.

Fortunately, the Bank's views appear to be adequately shared by the members of the Financial System Research Council. I would therefore like to discuss today the significance of the revision of the Bank of Japan Law to the Japanese economy as a whole.

First, this revision of the central bank system is a response to the global trend of changes, including financial and economic globalization and marketization, which have been driven by progress in financial innovation.

On various occasions in the past, I have discussed how in the new financial environment, markets around the world respond instantaneously to various information and they also respond to changes in the expectations of market participants as the participants process such information. The ""Big Bang"" package is likely to promote this tendency through increased efficiency and globalization of the markets. Under such circumstances, if the role and responsibility of the central bank in charge of monetary policy management are not made clear, or if both domestic and overseas understanding of the central bank's monetary policy management is insufficient, a country's monetary policy intentions may not permeate sufficiently throughout the market. In addition, irrelevant information may disrupt the markets.

The idea of entrusting the responsibility of ensuring price stability with the central bank, an establishment detached from short-term interests, is a wisdom acquired from the history of battles against inflation. The recent strengthening of central bank independence and the growing demand for transparency of monetary policy management around the world reflect the stronger emphasis on the status and responsibility of central banks to meet the new challenges presented by the global changes in the financial markets.

Second, in order for the financial markets or the financial system of a country to function efficiently and stably, appropriate policy and operational management by the central bank, which rests at the core of the financial system, is indispensable.

The Japanese financial system is a mechanism for intermediating savings and investments by efficient allocation of funds by means of a currency called ""yen."" In order for this mechanism to function properly, (1) the value of money -- in other words, domestic prices -- must be stable; (2) the mechanism for settling transactions by means of money must be efficient and convenient; and (3) private financial institutions, as the members of the financial system, as well as the central bank must be sound and reliable.

The maintenance of these three conditions -- that is, price stability, stable operations of the payment and settlement systems, and the resulting soundness of the financial system -- is the important responsibility of the central bank, an institution which has a primary role in the issuance and circulation of the ""yen."" The central bank system is thus an important component of the financial system infrastructure of Japan.

Therefore, in order to win domestic and overseas confidence in the Japanese financial markets and to maintain and improve the international competitiveness of these markets, it is essential that the central bank system is able to win domestic and overseas confidence, and that the market environment is improved through such efforts as the ""Big Bang"" reform package.

Third, many of the issues raised regarding the revision of the Bank of Japan Law can also be applied to the economic structural reform and to administrative reform in Japan.

The Bank of Japan has urged that (1) its organizational objectives and roles be clarified; and (2) the management of policy and operations be founded on a mechanism which allows the market participants and other third parties to monitor ex post facto whether the Bank is discharging its responsibility appropriately, rather than be part of a mechanism that attaches importance to advance coordination with the government.

This argument applies not only to the central bank. In fact, it may be applied generally to the question of what the economic and financial systems should be or what the role of government administration should take to meet the challenges of a new era.

The Japanese economy today is required to function within a mechanism under which any institution is responsible for its own course of action and then the market and the public examine and evaluate the actions taken, instead of within a system governed by advance examination based on administrative supervision and regulations.

Such reforms will fundamentally change the economic and social structures of Japan, making them more consistent with global standards. The old methodology of carrying out reforms within the conventional framework and ways of thinking must be changed. It is necessary to consider how the distinctive systems and ways of thinking in Japan could be changed from a perspective of global standards.

The issue of the revision of the Bank of Japan Law has drawn attention overseas along with the ""Big Bang"" package of financial reforms. This is because there vision of the Law is regarded as a test case of whether or not Japan can change itself.

To repeat my earlier point, the Bank of Japan strongly hopes that the two concepts put forward by the Central Bank Study Group -- that is, ensuring central bank independence and enhancing transparency -- will be clearly reflected in the revised Bank of Japan Law. I wish to make clear that the revision of the Law is not an issue that solely concerns the Bank of Japan, the monetary authorities, and the financial community, but is an issue closely related to the future course of the Japanese economy as a whole.

It is very important for the Bank of Japan to prove its ability to reform itself and to win domestic and overseas confidence through constant efforts toward appropriate policy and operational management. As part of such efforts, the Bank last year announced plans for the revision of policy and operational management, including the holding of regular meetings of the Policy Board for monetary policy decisions and the disclosure of the summary of those meetings. We at the Bank are determined to further promote vigorously institutional and operational reform.

I would like to conclude by asking for your continued understanding and support. I am most grateful for the kind attention you have given me today.",,Negative,0.5392882824,,
"Feb. 28, 1997","Speech given by Yasuo Matsushita, Governor of the Bank of Japan, to the Center for Economic Research in Tokyo on February 28,1997 (Payment and Settlement Systems: The Current Issues in Japan)","Introduction
I am greatly honored to have been invited by the Japan Center for Economic Research to address this distinguished audience. I wish to take this opportunity to first briefly discuss the recent monetary and economic conditions, and then address the current issues regarding the payment and settlement systems in Japan.

There have not been many opportunities to discuss payment and settlement on occasions such as this, despite the fact that they are important to all the economic activities of households and firms, and that as a central bank, we are very much involved in the developments in this area. I have not addressed this area partly due to its technical nature, but recently several developments have attracted much attention to the payment and settlement issues in Japan, as in other countries: specifically, pilot projects of electronic money products and the Bank's plans to abolish the designated-time settlement mode to make real-time gross settlement the only way of settlement on the Bank of Japan Financial Network System (BOJ-NET).

The role of the central bank in ensuring a smooth and stable operation of payment and settlement systems has become clearly recognized through the deliberations on the revision of the Bank of Japan Law that have been taking place since last year. The ""Report on the Revision of the Bank of Japan Law,"" released recently by the Financial System Research Council, an advisory committee to the Minister of Finance, states one of the objectives of the Bank of Japan to be ""to ensure smooth fund settlement among financial institutions, thereby contributing to the maintenance of an orderly financial system.""

I wish therefore to discuss today the current issues regarding the payment and settlement systems in Japan and also refer to the role of the central bank in those systems, bearing in mind the domestic and overseas trend in these areas.

II. Domestic Monetary and Economic Conditions
I would like to start by reviewing the recent economic condition and the thinking behind the Bank's current monetary policy management.

With regard to the domestic economic condition, the Bank of Japan judges that a moderate economic recovery continues and that the recovery is gradually becoming firmer.

A notable change in the economic condition since the latter half of 1996 is that the decline in external demand, which had been a factor constraining the economic recovery, halted in autumn 1996 following the depreciation of the yen. Recently there has been an upward trend in external demand. In addition, inventory adjustment in some raw materials and semiconductor industries had almost reached completion by the end of 1996. As a result, production has started to grow at an accelerating pace, reflecting fully the increase in final demand. Personal consumption continues to grow moderately but steadily, supported by the buoyant sales of passenger cars, and the recovery in business fixed investment is spreading to a wider range of industries and to smaller firms than previously observed, reflecting improvements in corporate sales and profits.

It should be borne in mind that increase in demand ahead of the rise in the consumption tax rate scheduled for fiscal 1997 is contributing to the recent improvement in economic indicators, as in housing investment, and these improvements need to be seen in this light. However, despite a gradual decrease in public-sector investment from the latter half of 1996, the virtuous circle -- in which increased production leads to a recovery in business fixed investment and personal consumption through improved corporate profits and employment income -- is gradually becoming more apparent. This improvement is encouraging.

In contrast to these recent improvements in economic indicators, the beginning of the year saw a significant fall in stock prices and this, together with the decline in long-term interest rates in the financial markets, indicates that the confidence of the market participants in the economic outlook is still slow to improve.

Various causes can be considered for the market's uncertainty as to future developments in the economy. While the renewed concern over the nonperforming-loan problem of financial institutions may be one important factor, the strong awareness of the effects of the anticipated fiscal tightening in the next fiscal year is also significant.

From spring to summer this year, a temporary slowdown in economic recovery seems inevitable due to a reaction to the boost in demand that is occurring ahead of the rise in the consumption tax rate. However, given the strengthening of the virtuous circle, it is more likely than before that the recovery trend of the economy will be sustained. In addition, stock prices appear to have stabilized. Therefore, in considering whether the economy can overcome the effects of fiscal tightening to sustain the trend of recovery, it is important to examine macro- and micro-economic data, including the economic indicators that will be released in the future, signals from financial markets, and firms' business plans for the next fiscal year.

I will now turn to the environment surrounding domestic prices. The depreciation of the yen has continued since the beginning of the year, and a rise in the consumption tax rate is planned for April. The raising of the tax rate will be passed on to product prices, pushing up the price index accordingly. However, as long as the price hike does not surpass the increase caused by the raising of the consumption tax rate, the price rise will only reflect a single price adjustment, and will not indicate any fundamental change in the situation underlying prices. Therefore it would not be appropriate to formulate monetary policy to counter such superficial changes in price indexes.

From the viewpoint of monetary policy management, that is, the viewpoint of ensuring stable economic development through price stability, the issue of concern is whether the rise in the tax rate will trigger price hikes that take advantage of the increase or will lead to inflationary expectations, which in turn might bring about price rises beyond the immediate effects of the tax rate increase. Whether such a general price increase will occur depends on various factors, including the prevailing domestic supply and demand conditions and consumer confidence. It is thus necessary to pay attention to the inflationary expectations and the possible negative developments, including overreaction by consumers, resulting from the rise in the consumption tax rate, rather than focusing attention on the superficial hikes in prices.

Although the decline in prices began to slow from the end of 1996, there is only a limited possibility that domestic prices will take a clear upward path given that improvement in the supply and demand conditions in the domestic economy is expected to remain moderate for now. However, in view of the accelerating rise in import prices reflecting the yen's depreciation and higher crude oil prices since the latter half of 1996, together with the strengthening of the recovery in private demand, it remains necessary to pay careful attention to the developments in domestic prices.

In the management of current monetary policy, the Bank of Japan will continue to monitor economic developments closely, placing emphasis on further strengthening the foundation of an economic recovery.

III. Current Issues Regarding the Payment and Settlement Systems in Japan
A. Payment and Settlement Systems in Japan
I would now like to move on to the main theme of today's speech: payment and settlement systems. The expression ""payment and settlement systems"" may sound somewhat technical and may indeed be unfamiliar to you. In a market economy, however, every economic activity conducted by firms and households -- be it production or consumption -- is concluded with settlement. Payment and settlement systems, or mechanisms for clearing and settling payments, are therefore used directly or indirectly by every economic entity. People may not be conscious of the functions of the systems when they operate smoothly and efficiently. However, once a problem arises, great difficulties are encountered.

The means of payment used by firms and households vary from cash -- that is, banknotes and coins -- to checks and bills, funds transfers between bank accounts, and credit cards. When payment is made by cash, settlement is final there and then. However, when payment is made by other means such as checks or bills, the mere handing over of the checks and bills will not complete the settlement of the transaction. When a check is drawn, for example, settlement is final only when the check is collected and the stated amount of money is transferred from the deposit money in the bank account of the payer to the bank account of the payee. If such transfers are not effected between accounts for some reason, for example, there are insufficient funds in the payer's account, the transaction will remain unsettled. When the payer and the payee hold accounts at different banks, interbank settlement is needed, and settlement will be completed only after the corresponding debit and credit entries are made to the current accounts held by each bank with the Bank of Japan.

Although various means of payment are available to firms and households, settlement is ultimately made either by a handing over of cash issued by the Bank of Japan or by a transfer of funds between bank accounts using deposit money, which are liabilities of private financial institutions. ""Money"" in a modern society therefore comprises cash and deposit money, and is reliant on the confidence of the public that bank deposits can be converted into cash at any time.

When a large number of relatively small-value payments, such as those using checks and bills, need to be settled between banks, they are not settled one at a time between the accounts held by the banks at the Bank of Japan. Rather, payment instruments such as checks and bills are collected and exchanged at clearing houses, where the credit and debit positions of each bank are calculated, and then the net positions are settled between the BOJ accounts. This calculation process is called clearing, and is operated by private institutions. Specifically, there are three major private clearing systems in Japan: the bill and check-clearing system; the Zengin DataTelecommunications System (Zengin System) for funds transfers between bank accounts and for credit card payments; and the Foreign Exchange Yen Clearing System for yen payments arising from foreign exchange and Euro-yen transactions.

BOJ accounts are used to settle the net positions resulting from various clearing systems, as well as to directly settle large-value interbank funds transactions, such as call-money transactions, which do not go through clearing processes. The value of funds transfers at the Bank of Japan totals approximately 300 trillion yen per day, which is equivalent to approximately 60 percent of Japan's annual GDP.

B. The Role of the Central Bank in Payment and Settlement Systems
Bank of Japan thus plays an important role in both the settlement made by cash and the settlement made by deposit money. The duty of central banks is to issue and control money -- that is, to ensure the public's confidence in the holding and the using of money.

To this end, two conditions must be satisfied: (1) the value of money must be stable -- that is, price stability must be maintained; and (2) the circulation of money and the functioning of payment and settlement systems must be stable and efficient. If it were not possible to use cash and deposits as desired for settlements, people would not be able to hold money with confidence. The mission of central banks, therefore, is to make the currencies they issue more convenient to use and to thereby enable firms and households to confidently engage in daily transactions and funds settlements. Bank of Japan thus plays a vital role in the settlement process in Japan as a whole.

Bank of Japan serves two specific functions in securing the stability and efficiency of the country's payment and settlement systems: (1) providing the means of settlement to the public; and (2) attending to the smooth execution of payments and settlements in Japan.

As a provider of the means of settlement, the Bank issues Bank of Japan notes and ensures their smooth circulation. As I mentioned earlier, cash payments immediately complete the settlement of a transaction by delivering a means of payment directly to the counterparty. This on-the-spot completion of settlement, whereby the payee is able to secure the monetary value received, is described as ""settlement with finality.""

In order to maintain the finality of cash payments, it is essential to secure the confidence of the people in the soundness of the central bank's assets, which underpins the value of the banknotes. The Bank thus pays close attention to the soundness of its assets. Furthermore, any circulation of counterfeit notes would undermine people's confidence in holding money. To prevent such an occurrence, the Bank examines the authenticity of the large volumes of banknotes that are returned to the Bank of Japan every day from financial institutions. Careful attention is also paid to the cleanness of each of the banknotes in circulation. The Bank also exerts itself to the utmost to improve anti-counterfeiting measures, and has recently been engaged in joint research with overseas central banks on the prevention of banknote counterfeiting using color copiers. Through such efforts, the Bank aims to preclude the circulation of counterfeits.

The Bank also provides current accounts at the Bank as another means of settlement. The Bank offers accounts to private financial institutions, and the funds in these accounts, or deposit money, are equivalent to banknotes in their function as a means of settlement with finality. In order to improve the safety and efficiency of settlements using these BOJ accounts, the Bank has made various efforts, including the introduction of the BOJ-NET -- the Bank of Japan Financial Network System, which is an on-line system for funds transfers among the current accounts held by private financial institutions with the Bank of Japan. The Bank intends to further improve the system in cooperation with those concerned by making real-time gross settlement the only settlement mode, which I shall discuss in detail later.

The second function of the Bank of Japan with regard to the payment and settlement systems is to attend to the safety and efficiency of payments and settlements in Japan, and to provide adequate liquidity when necessary. As I mentioned earlier, the important tasks of the Bank include ensuring a smooth supply of banknotes throughout the country, and monitoring the stability of daily settlements across the BOJ accounts. In addition, the Bank, in coordination with the operators of the private clearing systems such as the bill and check clearing, plays an important role in preventing any troubles in the systems or participants from jeopardizing the entire payment and settlement systems in Japan.

In any settlement system, there is the risk that a failure of one bank to meet its obligations will trigger a chain reaction of defaults, eventually paralyzing the entire system. In addition, both payment and settlement systems and individual banks constituting the systems are supported by the market's confidence. As this confidence is in large part a psychological factor, a failure of a single bank could lead to a run on deposits at other banks. Such risk is referred to as systemic risk. Materialization of systemic risk will disrupt not only settlements between banks but also those between firms and households, having a profound impact on the economy and on the society as a whole. Such systemic risk inherent in the network of settlements is what differentiates the banking sector from other industrial sectors.

The role of the central bank is to constantly monitor the institutional framework and the operation of payment and settlement systems, working in coordination with the parties concerned to thereby prevent the materialization of systemic risk. The central bank must also ensure that the system can be provided the funds to break the chain reaction of defaults should some emergency occur. Another important task of the central bank is to attend to the soundness of the private financial institutions, which are the participants in the payment and settlement systems and which settle the payments between firms and households. To summarize these roles, an important mission of the central bank is to maintain the safety and efficiency of the entire settlement process, a process which involves (1) private financial institutions which accept the deposits of firms and households; (2) private clearing organizations processing interbank payments; and (3) the central bank which discharges interbank settlement obligations resulting from private-sector clearing systems.

C. Measures to Improve the Safety of Payment and Settlement Systems
Payment and settlement systems have not necessarily been an issue of public interest reflecting the general perception that these systems are mechanical processing units for discharging obligations by inputting transaction data. The fact that there had been no financial institution failures until recently and that payments have been settled safely may have supported this perception. However, financial institutions have actually failed and the speed at which systemic risk is transmitted within and beyond international borders has increased significantly owing to technological innovations in finance and telecommunications, and financial globalization. Under these circumstances, it is inappropriate to view payment and settlement systems as merely mechanical processing units. These systems must be resilient against systemic risk, and the establishing of such systems is an extremely important challenge for both the private financial institutions and for the central bank. It becomes apparent that various incidents and studies have raised the awareness of the need to improve the safety of payment and settlement systems among private financial institutions and central banks both in Japan and abroad.

In various countries, new safety standards have been applied to private clearing systems. These standards include limits on each participant's net debit position and collateral requirements to ensure the provision of adequate backup liquidity in the event of an inability to settle by the participant having the largest single net-debit position. These standards were devised by the central banks of the Group of Ten countries as minimum standards to be satisfied by cross-border and multi-currency netting schemes, and are referred to as the Lamfalussy standards, after the chairman of the committee on this study. As these standards can apply to domestic clearing systems, they are being used recently in many countries as guidelines for improving the integrity of private clearing systems.

In Japan, it has recently been decided to enhance the safety measures of the Foreign Exchange Yen Clearing System so as to satisfy the Lamfalussy standards. The Bank will continue to actively support the initiatives to improve the safety of the payment and settlement systems.

D. Improving the Safety of the Central Bank's Settlement System -- Real-Time Gross Settlement
The need to improve safety applies not only to private clearing systems but also to the settlement systems operated by central banks. In this regard, an increasing number of central banks have been adopting real-time gross settlement for current account settlements at the central bank. Real-time gross settlement -- called RTGS for short -- is a system in which the central bank processes and effects every payment instruction sent by private financial institutions in real time and on an order-by-order basis.

Most central banks, including the Bank of Japan, have typically conducted interbank settlements on a designated-time basis rather than by RTGS. In the conventional designated-time settlement, payment instructions are accumulated until designated settlement times instead of each one being settled immediately. At the designated time -- at present, 9 a.m., 1 p.m., 3 p.m., and 5 p.m. in Japan -- the net settlement position of each financial institution is computed and its account is credited or debited simultaneously.

In designated-time settlement, financial institutions need only the funds equivalent to their net debit positions at the time of settlement, and thus, it is an efficient system from the viewpoint of fund management. However, if a single financial institution in the system were to fail to meet its obligations, all payments would inevitably be suspended, in order that all the payment instructions sent or received by that financial institution could be revoked to recompute the settlement obligations of each financial institution. In addition, such failure could create a shortage of funds at the financial institutions which had planned to make payments with the funds they had expected to receive from the failed financial institution. This may lead to a series of liquidity shortages or defaults -- that is, the materialization of systemic risk. The effects of this risk could be grave, considering that the amount of funds handled by the central bank's settlement system is substantial.

With RTGS, the smooth execution of settlements solely depends on the ability of the parties concerned to meet their obligations, as every payment instruction is processed in real time on an order-by-order basis. Therefore, even if a bank were to suddenly become unable to settle, disruption to the system would be limited: suspension of the operation of the entire settlement system, which can occur under designated-time settlement, can be avoided. The introduction of RTGS in many countries around the world, including some Asian countries, is a result of the efforts of central banks to improve their settlement systems to contain systemic risk.

Against this background, the Bank of Japan also decided at the end of 1996 to make RTGS the only mode of settlement via BOJ accounts. Specifically, by the end of the year 2000, the Bank plans to abolish designated-time settlement and make all funds transfers on the basis of RTGS. This may require market participants to establish new transaction and settlement practices. To ensure the smooth operation of RTGS, the Bank intends to directly supply intraday liquidity, which is indispensable for smooth settlements, to cover liquidity shortages that might arise in the system despite the efforts of participant financial institutions.

Last December, the Bank announced its policy to realize RTGS as the only settlement mode on the BOJ-NET with some specific proposals for design features and requested comments from the public. The Bank was fortunate to receive many valuable comments and recognized the increasing awareness of settlement risk among market participants. The Bank believes that it has been able to gain strong support from the private financial institutions for RTGS, and plans to publish in the near future its policies along with the comments received. The Bank strongly hopes to receive constructive opinions and suggestions in deciding the details of the design of the system. The Bank will also solicit views from a broad range of market participants whenever making a major change in the operation of the Bank's settlement system, as a change in the system could have a significant impact on the market practices and the daily business of the financial institutions participating in the system.

It should be noted that realization of RTGS does not necessarily mean the elimination of all the risks in payment and settlement systems. Moreover, RTGS on the BOJ-NET will produce the desired effects only when the safety of the private clearing systems connected to the Bank's system is ensured. To illustrate this point, suppose that the private financial institutions, for some reason, switched from direct settlements via BOJ accounts to indirect settlements using private clearing systems given the introduction of RTGS. The total amount of risks in the payment and settlement systems as a whole would not decrease if there were inadequate management of risks in the private systems. In this respect, it is indispensable for the private financial institutions, the private clearing organizations, and the central bank to work together to enhance the efficiency and safety of the payment and settlement systems in Japan.

Such efforts of the private sector and the central bank to improve the infrastructure for settlements will also contribute to the strengthening of the global competitiveness of Japan's financial markets, which is indeed the aim of the Japanese ""Big Bang"" deregulation package proposed by Prime Minister Hashimoto.

E. Improvement in Securities Settlement Systems
In addition to the safety of funds settlements, much attention has been paid globally to the safety of settlements of securities such as government securities and stocks.

Although I do not have enough time today to discuss this issue in detail, the established guidelines for risk management in securities settlements are the recommendations set out in 1989 by the Group of Thirty, an international group of experts in finance.

In accordance with the recommendations, significant progress has been made recently in Japan toward improving the settlement systems for securities. For the settlement of Japanese government securities (JGS), for example, an on-line network and delivery-versus-payment system have been established. Delivery versus payment, known as DVP, is a mechanism which links the delivery of JGS with the corresponding funds transfer so that both are executed simultaneously. In such a way, a failure to collect payments or receive securities can be avoided. In addition, rolling settlement was introduced in October 1996. Here, settlements are made on every business day for the contracts that were agreed on a specific number of business days previous to that settlement date (currently seven days). This replaces the prior arrangement where contracts made over a certain period were accumulated before they were settled on one of the six designated settlement days of each month (the 5th, 10th, 15th, 20th, 25th, and the last day of the month). The system will be improved further in April 1997 to complete settlement on the third business day after the date of contract.

Regarding settlement of corporate bonds, which may be familiar to many of you here, delivery of bonds has conventionally been made by a document called registration certificate and the corresponding payment has been settled separately through clearing of bills. At the end of 1997, however, on-line delivery of corporate bonds will be brought into effect. A delivery-versus-payment service is also envisioned for the future by connecting the settlement system for corporate bonds with the BOJ-NET.

Various efforts are thus under way in Japan to enhance the safety of securities settlements. However, much remains to be improved. A large volume of stocks and other securities continues to be delivered physically, and DVP systems are yet to be established for such securities. Furthermore, the lag between the contract and the settlement, that is, the final transfers of securities and funds, needs to be shortened for various securities. In this respect, the Bank intends to contribute actively and expects further efforts on the part of the private sector.

F. Developments in Electronic Money
I would now like to briefly discuss the developments in electronic money, which might become a popular means of settlement in the future.

The term electronic money is used to refer to payment mechanisms in which electronic records of funds are stored in devices such as IC cards -- with microprocessor chip (integrated circuits) embedded -- or in computer networks and then transferred safely from one customer to another. Many pilot projects are under way in various countries, making use of the recent technological innovations in IC cards and computer networks as well as in such security features as encryption. In Japan as well, financial institutions and firms have begun various projects individually or jointly. For example, some banks are individually using IC-card based electronic money on trial within certain buildings in Tokyo. A joint project by a credit card company and several banks on card-based electronic money is also being planned for summer 1998 in a certain area of Tokyo. It is said to be of the largest one of its kind in the world, involving approximately 1,000 stores and 100,000 cards.

When electronic money products become prevalent, they may be used as new means of settlement replacing cash and deposits. People may settle various retail transactions by transferring the electronic values between IC cards or on networks instead of banknotes and coins. To prepare for this possibility, central banks are keenly interested in the soundness and the implications of electronic money developments. From this viewpoint, the central banks of the Group of Ten countries have been studying various aspects of electronic money: security features to prevent fraud and counterfeiting, implications for the effectiveness of the central bank's monetary policy, and the stability of payment and settlement systems.

At present, however, it is very difficult to project how electronic money technology will develop, to what extent electronic money products will be used by the public as a substitute for cash or deposit money, and at what pace these developments will proceed. The pace of the developments will depend on how the reliability of electronic money products is secured and how conveniently these products are utilized. Under these circumstances, it is not easy to reach a verdict on the various relevant issues, nor would it be appropriate to jump to conclusions. Developers and operators of electronic money schemes can be expected to exercise ingenuity on such aspects as security and legal matters, and the innovative capabilities of the private sector should not be discouraged. The basic stance that the Bank should maintain at present is to be flexible to the various possibilities concerning the future course of development in electronic money.

Regarding the implications of the development of electronic money on monetary policy, monetary policy will, in theory, continue to be effective, provided that the situation does not become one where electronic money extensively substitutes not only for cash as a means of retail payment but also for deposit money for large-value transfers. Although the spread of electronic money products might affect the stability of monetary indicators, this will be adequately managed by identifying the amount outstanding of electronic money issued and by devising monetary policy management. Therefore, I wish to state that the Bank of Japan does not intend to put a brake on the development and introduction of electronic money in consideration of its effects on monetary policy.

Maintaining this stance, the Bank intends to continue research on electronic money while observing the developments in the private sector in Japan and abroad. It will release the results of the research, as it has done in the past, wishing to support the efforts of the private sector.

G. The Necessity of Risk Management by Individual Financial Institutions
I have so far discussed the developments regarding payment and settlement systems to contain systemic risk. It is obvious, however, that establishing an appropriate system structure alone is not enough to secure the safety of the systems. It is also important for the system participants, or individual financial institutions, to improve risk control measures by establishing a system for identifying and managing settlement risk.

In a modern society, monetary systems, as mentioned earlier, are based on the public's confidence in: (1) cash issued by the central bank; and (2) deposit money offered by private financial institutions. In order for monetary systems to function smoothly, it is necessary for the financial system as a whole to function with stability and, to that end, financial institutions themselves need to be responsible for securing sound management, including management of settlement risk.

It is evident that financial institutions should manage their risks rigorously. Compared to credit and interest rate risks, settlement risk tends to cause greater losses and disruptions once it materializes, and yet they are difficult to identify and manage. In fact, settlement risk constantly fluctuates significantly, and thus identification and management of the risk require comprehensive understanding of technical details related to processing. For example, it is necessary to know how the payment and settlement systems of different currencies work, and what risks arise from time lags. Such information and skills cannot be acquired overnight. However, in view of the impact settlement risk could have on financial institutions, it is indispensable to establish a system which makes possible the identification and measurement of settlement risk and the immediate reduction of risk following decisions by the management.

I would like to emphasize that a financial institution equipped with an efficient risk management system will be able to acquire new business opportunities in the area of payment and settlement services. In fact, many European and U.S. financial institutions are creating and offering new business out of settlement operations. They are putting in large amount of resources to establish adequate internal risk management, and are developing safe and efficient settlement services to provide to financial institutions and other customers. The fact that such operations are viable as business is an indication that European and U.S. financial institutions and firms actively use new innovative payment and settlement services to realize safe and efficient settlements.

IV. Conclusion
In summarizing today's discussion on payment and settlement systems, I would like to address the basic issues from a somewhat different point of view.

Firstly, payment and settlement systems play an extremely important role in the economy as an infrastructure supporting all economic activities, although this is rarely acknowledged in our daily lives. When firms purchase raw materials and sell products, or when households receive wages and salaries, purchase goods, and remit money, all these activities are based on the assumption that payments and settlements of money are effected smoothly -- in a manner that people would not even be conscious of it. To satisfy this requirement, modern society has developed a complex and precise mechanism comprising the central bank and the private sector. The expressions ""financial institutions"" and ""financial system"" may generally bring to mind the function of intermediating savings and investment through the borrowing and lending of money. Providing safe and efficient settlement services, however, is an equally important function that the central bank and the private financial institutions serve.

Secondly, efforts to further improve the utility and safety of the settlement systems are becoming all the more important as economic transactions become increasingly complex and globalized and as technological innovations in finance including the payment and settlement systems progress. The Lamfalussy standards, RTGS, and the recommendations of the Group of Thirty are indeed part of such efforts.

As technology continues to progress, however, there is no final goal for the development of payment and settlement systems. In addition, financial globalization is intensifying cross-border linkages, with settlement troubles in one country affecting the settlement systems of other countries. It is therefore important for the private sector and central banks to work together to improve the payment and settlement systems by reviewing the safety standards as necessary from a global perspective. We at the Bank of Japan shall continue our efforts to enhance the safety and efficiency of the BOJ-NET, and shall support the efforts of the private sector to improve their systems.

Thirdly, it is important to ensure the soundness of the financial system in a broader sense. As I mentioned repeatedly, the functioning of modern monetary systems has its foundations in the public's confidence in the central bank and the private financial institutions. In order for monetary systems to function properly, the entire financial system needs to operate with stability.

Sound management founded on the responsibility of the financial institutions is fundamental in establishing the confidence in private financial institutions. It is necessary for the central bank to function as the lender of last resort should a trouble which emerged in one part of the settlement system be anticipated to spread throughout the entire system -- although it is important to contain such risks in advance, sometimes it may unfortunately become impossible to prevent an incident from having impact on the entire system -- so that people's everyday lives will not be seriously affected. In order to prevent the materialization of systemic risk, it is essential for the central bank to assess, through regular on-site examinations and daily monitoring, whether the soundness of individual financial institutions is secured, whether there is excessive concentration of risks in the financial system as a whole, and whether the series of transactions between financial institutions is being settled smoothly.

In summary, payment and settlement systems are vital to every economic entity including the firms and individuals represented here. As the central bank, one of whose missions is to secure the soundness of the financial system, the Bank of Japan will continue its efforts to improve the safety and efficiency of Japan's payment and settlement systems. In this regard, your suggestions and comments will be extremely valuable.

Thank you very much for your kind attention.",,Positive,0.7966041565,,
"Apr. 14, 1997","Speech given by Yasuo Matsushita, Governor of the Bank of Japan, to the Kisaragi-kai meeting in Tokyo on April 14, 1997 (Recent Monetary and Economic Conditions in Japan and the Reform of the Financial Markets)","Introduction
I am greatly honored to have been invited today to address this distinguished audience. I would like to take this opportunity to first discuss recent monetary and economic conditions in Japan and issues regarding the financial system. I would then like to discuss the Bank of Japan's views on financial market reform in Japan, the subject of heated discussion since Prime Minister Hashimoto proposed the ""Big Bang"" deregulation package for Japan on November 11, 1996.

The financial markets constitute the infrastructure supporting a nation's economy, and thus their efficient and stable functioning is essential to the promotion of unhindered economic growth in the long term. Accordingly, market reform has become an urgent issue in Japan, as the financial markets seem to be losing international competitiveness. However, various arguments are being heard on the pace and the potential side effects of the reform. Bearing these arguments in mind, I wish to return to the basics of market reform and discuss why a reform is currently needed in Japan and the approach to be taken in promoting the reform.

II. Recent Monetary and Economic Conditions in Japan
A. The Strength of Economic Recovery
I would like to start by examining the strength of the self-sustained economic recovery over the past several years.

According to the Economic Planning Agency, the current economic recovery began in October 1993, and has continued for about three and a half years. The recovery, however, has not been constant, and therefore, many people may not have been able to appreciate the true strength of the recovery.

In fact, the growth rate of the economy remained low at around 1 percent even after 1993, and there were concerns about the occurrence of a deflationary spiral at one time in 1995. This extremely slow pace of economic recovery was due to the fact that the Japanese economy had to overcome various structural adjustment pressures -- that is, pressures to reduce the burdens created by the bursting of the economic ""bubble"" and pressures to adapt to a new global economic environment.

Since 1996, however, the recovery in real economic activity has finally become evident.

Looking at the GDP growth in 1996, the contribution of fiscal expenditures, which had been large at the beginning of the year, gradually decreased. At the same time, the pace of decline in net exports (exports in excess of imports) slowed, and domestic private demand, such as business fixed investment and personal consumption, showed steady growth. Owing mostly to the increase in domestic private demand, GDP in the fourth quarter of 1996 grew by 2.9 percent over the same period of the previous year, despite the negative contribution by public works.

The key to the realization of a self-sustained economic recovery is the sustainability of recovery in domestic private demand. In this respect, there have been concerns that the recovery in business fixed investment might be due in large part to the temporary increase in investment in the telecommunications industry. Equally, there have been concerns that growth in housing investment and personal consumption might have been caused mainly by the boost in demand ahead of the rise in the consumption tax rate in fiscal 1997.

These issues must be examined from various points of view when judging the economic outlook for the current fiscal year. I would, however, like to emphasize here that a virtuous circle of demand, production, and income has gradually come into operation from the latter half of 1996.

During the first half of 1996, increase in demand did not bring about significant improvement in production, as the increase was offset by growth in imports and inventory adjustment. In the latter half of the year, however, the decline in external demand halted due to the depreciation of the yen, and, in addition, inventory adjustment progressed. As a result, the increase in final demand was reflected fully in production growth. In fact, the year-to-year growth rate of production improved from less than 1 percent in the first half of 1996 to 4.4 percent in the latter half of 1996, a level consistent with the growth in demand. The increase in production appears to have led to a recovery in business fixed investment and employment in the latter half of 1996, through increased corporate profits. This virtuous circle of demand, production, and income brightens the prospects for a sustained recovery in domestic private demand.

The strength of recovery, however, is different in each economic sector. According to the results of the March 1997 ""Tankan -- Short-Term Economic Survey of Enterprises in Japan,"" while increased corporate profits have been stimulating increases in business fixed investment, they have not to the same extent led to increased consumption through improved employment and wage conditions. In addition, while business fixed investment by large firms continues to increase, recovery in the levels of investment by smaller firms has not yet gained strength.

While several factors remain uncertain, the Bank of Japan judges that the economic recovery has gradually been firming since autumn 1996, on the basis of the developments in the economic growth rate and its factors, and the strengthening of the virtuous circle.

B. Future Economic and Price Developments, and Monetary Policy Management
The Bank will pay close attention to whether the self-sustained recovery of private demand from fiscal 1996 will further strengthen, leading to a firm recovery of the economy despite the downward pressures of fiscal tightening.

The developments in the financial markets indicate considerable concern on the part of market participants as to the firmness of economic recovery. Long-term interest rates continued to decline from autumn 1996 and have recently been at a historic low of 2.1 to 2.2 percent. Stock prices fell sharply at the beginning of the year with no significant improvement thereafter. The results of the March 1997 Tankan also indicated that while firms were confident about their business outlook in terms of expected sales and profits, they had little expectation of improvement in business conditions in the second quarter.

The low level of confidence in the economic outlook may be attributed to a variety of causes. The renewed concern over the nonperforming-loan problem of financial institutions and its effects on the economy may be one factor. With regard to the economic developments in the short-term, however, the most significant factors are likely to be the concerns over the downward pressures of fiscal tightening.

The Bank has not yet detected any clear signs of such downward pressures, and intends to continue examining the possible effects of fiscal tightening. There appear to be, however, several good reasons not to be too pessimistic.

Regarding fiscal tightening, public works are not to be cut drastically in the new fiscal year, but rather, have already been reduced gradually from the latter half of 1996. Despite the decline in public works, domestic private demand has continued to expand, supported in part by the improvement in external demand.

With regard to the rise in the consumption tax rate, it may have two different types of impact: (1) in the short term, the rise may induce an increase in demand ahead of its implementation and a subsequent reaction after the rate change; and (2) in the longer term, it may fundamentally affect consumer behavior.

As to the short-term influence, this may have made a certain contribution to the recent improvement in economic indicators such as increased automobile sales and department store sales. From April, therefore, it is likely that there will be some reaction against the increase. From the viewpoint of achieving a self-sustained economic recovery, however, what matters is how the increase in the consumption tax rate will fundamentally change consumer behavior through a decline in the purchasing power of households. The degree of the change will depend largely on consumer confidence and wage conditions. In this respect, the recent improvement in employment and wage conditions, though modest, is encouraging.

Nevertheless, a temporary slowdown in economic recovery is likely as the various effects of fiscal tightening will be seen most strongly between now and summer. The Bank, however, is also of the view that the current trend of recovery is likely to be maintained owing to the recent strengthening of the virtuous circle in the economy. In this respect, the Bank will continue to monitor closely economic developments, especially consumer behavior.

Turning to recent price developments, it has become increasingly clear that prices have stopped declining since the end of 1996, following an improvement in the domestic supply and demand conditions and a rise in import prices. While the decline in crude oil prices makes it unlikely that import prices will rise further, putting additional upward pressures on domestic prices, the Bank will continue to monitor price developments closely, including the effects of the depreciation of the yen.

If I should mention one point about the recent foreign exchange developments, it is that the Bank's thinking is based on the Group of Seven agreement that exchange rates should reflect economic fundamentals and that excess volatility is undesirable. While refraining from commenting on specific exchange rate levels, the Bank will continue to carefully watch foreign exchange rate developments, which have recently shown rather rapid movements.

Returning to the subject of prices, the raising of the consumption tax rate in April will be reflected in product prices, pushing up the price index accordingly. It would not be appropriate to formulate monetary policy against such a one-time, superficial price adjustment. The issue of concern is whether the rise in the tax rate will trigger price hikes taking advantage of the rise or will lead to inflationary expectations, which in turn might bring about price rises beyond the immediate effects of the tax rate increase. The Bank will also continue to monitor price developments carefully from this viewpoint, with particular attention given to the underlying domestic supply and demand conditions and consumer confidence.

In the management of current monetary policy, the Bank of Japan will continue to monitor economic developments closely, placing emphasis on further strengthening the foundation for an economic recovery.

III. Issues Regarding the Financial System
I would now like to move on to the issues regarding the financial system. From the end of fiscal 1996 to the beginning of fiscal 1997, a number of banks announced their intention to front-load their schedule of writing off nonperforming loans and to revise their business results for fiscal 1996 downward accordingly. On April 1, Nippon Credit Bank announced a comprehensive restructuring package, and Hokkaido Takushoku Bank and Hokkaido Bank announced their plan to merge in pursuit of more efficient management. These developments indicate the determination of Japanese financial institutions to adapt to the far-reaching reform of Japan's financial system, which I will discuss later, while continuing to strive to promptly resolve their nonperforming loans.

I would therefore like to discuss the implications that the decisions of Nippon Credit Bank and Hokkaido Takushoku Bank may have for Japan's financial system as a whole and for the nonperforming-loan problem with which the system is burdened.

Let me first explain the circumstances which led these banks to take such drastic actions. In recent years, significant progress has been made in the disposal of nonperforming loans by major financial institutions including city banks, long-term credit banks, and trust banks. As a result of active provisioning and write-offs, in fact, most banks already have a clear prospect of completing the disposal within a year or two.

Nippon Credit Bank and Hokkaido Takushoku Bank, however, have tended to fall behind others due to the large amount of nonperforming loans they hold relative to their financial strength. Needless to say, it has been believed that both banks could dispose of the nonperforming loans over an extended period of time. However, with the financial markets about to undergo a drastic change, financial institutions that will require time to solve their nonperforming-loan problem will unavoidably be placed under serious constraints as they try to survive the reform. With this in mind, domestic and overseas market participants have begun to scrutinize the financial conditions of Japanese financial institutions with increasing severity since the beginning of the year. In this context, the two banks were urged to set forth restructuring plans which are comprehensive enough to remove the sources of uncertainty in the market.

Nippon Credit Bank announced a plan which includes thorough restructuring, comprehensive disposal of nonperforming loans, and reinforcement of the capital base. Private financial institutions which have direct capital or business interest in Nippon Credit Bank have been asked to participate in the capital subscription to the bank. The capital which cannot be obtained from private financial institutions will be supplemented by the New Financial Stabilization Fund through the underwriting of preferred shares. This will be carried out using the outstanding amount which has been contributed to the Fund by the Bank of Japan. In this respect, the restructuring plan of Nippon Credit Bank involves public support. We at the Bank believe that Nippon Credit Bank is by no means insolvent, and that it is fully capable of reconstructing its financial position. We have at the same time determined that the entire financial system might be adversely influenced should the implementation of the comprehensive measures to solve the financial problems of Nippon Credit Bank be delayed, and should market confidence in the bank not be maintained or restored. Based on this judgment and in light of the objective of the Fund -- which is to ""enhance the stability of and global confidence in our country's financial system"" -- the Bank deemed it appropriate to utilize the New Financial Stabilization Fund to reinforce the capital base of Nippon Credit Bank.

Meanwhile, Hokkaido Takushoku Bank announced a plan to merge with Hokkaido Bank, also based in the Hokkaido region, with a view to becoming a so-called super-regional bank with a stable customer base in the Hokkaido region and with operations in a geographically larger area in the rest of Japan. As part of the planned merger, they announced a management strategy to strengthen the financial base, improve customer services, and thus contribute to invigorating the regional economy.

Although the cases of Nippon Credit Bank and Hokkaido Takushoku Bank are different, one involving public support and the other a commercial solution, the approaches taken by the two banks in coping with their problems have points in common.

First, both banks are to implement far-reaching restructuring measures in terms of their operation, personnel, and branches, which are unprecedented for major Japanese banks. The plans adopted by the two banks would be comparable to the drastic restructuring measures adopted by U.S. commercial banks in the latter half of the 1980s and in the early 1990s to solve their management problems.

Second, both banks plan to withdraw from overseas operations. Nippon Credit Bank subsequently announced an agreement on business collaboration with Bankers Trust of the United States. We at the Bank are strongly encouraged by these initiatives because they indicate a significant shift from the conventional strategy pursued to date by major Japanese banks, and will contribute significantly to the smooth implementation of the two banks' restructuring packages.

The common aspects of the two cases illustrate the determination of Japanese financial institutions to renovate themselves in order to adapt positively to the changing financial environment. As I shall discuss later, the Japanese financial system is undergoing a drastic change in preparation for the 21st century. These two cases reflect the fact that managements are seriously reconsidering their strategies, freeing themselves from their traditional way of thinking, through identifying areas of comparative advantage and improving customer services.

The measures taken by the two banks represent significant steps toward the resolution of nonperforming loans. The disposal of nonperforming loans by Nippon Credit Bank will reach a level comparable to other major banks. In addition, Hokkaido Takushoku Bank and Hokkaido Bank will be able to complete the disposal of their nonperforming loans much faster than they would have separately, for the merger will greatly enhance efficiency through such measures as reorganization and consolidation of branch network and elimination of redundant investment.

The decisions of the two banks are thus expected to contribute significantly to removing uncertainties from, and ensuring domestic and international confidence in the Japanese financial system. At the same time, the Bank believes that the proposed measures are of great significance in the sense that they represent voluntary action taken by financial institutions in preparation for the fundamental reform of the Japanese financial system.

IV. Financial Market Reform
A. The Necessity for Market Reform
I would now like to move on to the other theme of my speech, the financial market reform in Japan. Specific measures of the Big Bang deregulation package for Japan are currently under deliberation in the relevant councils. I would therefore like to discuss the fundamental points of this issue, such as why a reform of the financial markets and the financial system is currently needed, and the approach to be taken in promoting the reform.

Today, financial innovations are in progress around the world, and new financial instruments and transactions are being developed one after another. At the same time, however, the Japanese financial markets seem to be losing international competitiveness. This is the main reason the markets need to be reformed. Failure to heighten competitiveness would result in the hollowing out of the Japanese financial markets, eventually threatening the sound development of the Japanese economy.

Since the 1980s, Japan has gradually deregulated the financial sector. Interest rates on deposits have been liberalized, and banks and securities companies have been permitted to enter into each other's fields of business through subsidiaries. During this period, however, the Tokyo market has fallen far behind the New York and London markets in its ability to develop diverse financial instruments and services. This is partly because Japanese financial institutions had to divert much of their energy to the disposal of nonperforming loans, a burden created by the bursting of the economic ""bubble."" It is also attributable to the conventional frameworks of the Japanese financial markets and the financial system, which have been left unchanged despite the rapidly changing financial environment, making it difficult to develop and introduce new financial instruments and services.

Globally, the most conspicuous change in the financial markets in recent years has been the rapid progress in financial innovations, reflecting the development of computer and communications technology. New financial instruments such as derivatives and securitization have made it possible to unbundle risks -- namely, credit risk, interest rate risk, and foreign exchange risk -- of conventional financial instruments such as loans and bonds, and trade these risks individually or as various combinations of risks. The risks traded through the new financial instruments are no different from those originally incorporated in the conventional financial products. However, the range of services that financial institutions can provide has expanded significantly as it has become possible to trade only the risks without paying for or delivering the underlying asset.

Conventional financial services, for example, focused on the flow of funds, that is, investment and financing, of firms and households. In comparison, recent financial services place greater emphasis on analyzing the overall risks of the assets and liabilities of firms to hedge those risks or to take new risks. The services can thus be elaborately tailored to the specific financial conditions of individual customers. In other words, it has become possible for firms and households to manage their portfolios efficiently and more flexibly by utilizing custom-made services based on advice from financial institutions. The words derivatives and securitization may sound irrelevant to households, but they have in fact increased opportunities for households to efficiently manage their assets and liabilities, by expanding the range of assets in which pension trusts and investment trusts can be invested indirectly through institutional investors, and by increasing the range of instruments which can be accessed directly by households.

Along with the progress in financial innovations, advances in computer and communications technology are further promoting financial globalization. Today, firms and institutional investors around the world are not only transferring funds frequently across borders, but are also accessing financial markets worldwide on a daily basis in pursuit of the best means to control risk. In terms of technical capability at least, by utilizing computer networks, even firms that are small in scale can solicit funds directly from overseas investors and individuals can deal directly with overseas financial institutions.

Availability of diverse financial services to meet the potential needs of firms and households provides the basis for revitalizing the financial sector as a growth industry. Countries around the world have recognized the financial sector as a high growth industry, and for this reason they have been vying with each other in the reform of their domestic financial markets. The Big Bang implemented in the United Kingdom in the mid-1980s was in fact aimed at strengthening the financial sector as the leading industry of the country's economy by attracting back to London financial transactions that had shifted to the United States.

The development and introduction of diverse financial services is becoming increasingly important in Japan as well, given the changes in the flow of capital in Japan and abroad. With the accumulation of personal assets and the need to prepare for the aging of society, there is a growing demand in the household sector for diversification of assets and risks, while the corporate sector is waiting for the emergence of venture businesses to lead growth industries and the establishment of new channels to facilitate the supply of capital to such businesses.

There is concern, however, as to whether the Japanese financial markets have the capacity to create financial services and instruments which can satisfy the various needs of the corporate and household sectors.

The conventional framework of the Japanese financial system has divided the industry by type of business, entrusted each type of business to specialized financial institutions, and prohibited institutions from entering into other types of business. The majority opinion is that this institutional segmentation of financial businesses was effective in supplying capital to priority industries during the postwar reconstruction period and the era of high economic growth. With the rapidly expanding scope of financial services and the diversifying needs of users, however, the appropriateness of such segmentation has come into question. It must indeed be thoroughly examined whether it is impeding the provision of efficient financial services and introduction of new financial technology, and whether it is restricting market competition.

It is also important to review the institutional frameworks of the legal, tax, and accounting systems to make them suitable for the financial services of the new era.

If the institutional frameworks are not improved, even transactions between residents may shift to overseas markets due to the exercise of choice by market participants. This may be called ""transactions flight"" rather than ""capital flight."" As the financial markets constitute the infrastructure supporting the economic activity of a country, hollowing out of the markets must be prevented.

B. The Basic Approach to Market Reform
As I have explained, market reform should not be conducted as a mere deregulation process. Rather, it should be promoted from the viewpoint of creating an internationally competitive market and making the market attractive to domestic and overseas participants. In doing so, it must be remembered that countries around the world are also striving to attract domestic and cross-border financial transactions to their own markets by enhancing their international competitiveness. That is to say, while the systems of various countries differ significantly, each country is reviewing its existing system on a continuous basis in pursuit of improved efficiency. Therefore, if we simply consider the present New York and London markets as our goal, we might find ourselves trailing behind those markets by the time reform in Japan is realized. In other words, it is most important to try to be one or two steps ahead of the times as we rebuild Japan's financial markets.

The frame of reference in these efforts is to fully utilize the creativity of the private sector, or in other words, to maximize the functioning of the market mechanism. In fact, the driving force for the development of the New York and London markets has been the innovative strength of the market mechanism. It is therefore important that existing regulations be reviewed and abolished as much as possible while placing stronger emphasis on market participants' self-responsibility and on honoring market discipline. It is essential that a framework be built in which diverse financial services are made available to the public, enabling them to choose the most efficient products or products that sufficiently meet their various needs. Such a framework will not only promote greater efficiency of the entire financial system by drawing out innovative ideas through competition, but should also contribute to the stability of the financial system by putting to work the check mechanism inherent in markets.

When we look back at the Japanese financial markets from this perspective, we see that every attempt to introduce a new financial product, such as commercial paper or securitized instruments, required a lengthy process before the product could actually be launched. This was because there was always heated debate about whether the new product could be construed as a negotiable security under the Securities Exchange Act of 1948, in order to determine which type of financial institution, that is, securities companies or banks, would handle the product.

Another feature of the Japanese financial markets has been the restrictions or conditions imposed to limit the risk carried by securities traded on the capital market, that is, those imposed on the investment instruments of institutional investors and on the corporate issuers of negotiable securities. Examples are the restrictions on equity investment by investment trusts and pension funds and the qualification criteria for corporate bond issues, which were abolished at the end of 1995. This feature, however, seems to have constrained the basic function of the capital market which is to realize efficient transfers of business risks based on the price mechanism and has consequently restricted access to the capital market.

Such features of the Japanese financial markets had the aim of protecting investors, which was realized by making specific institutions responsible for specific financial instruments, and then regulating and supervising the institutions responsible for handling the financial products. Should this remain unchanged, however, new financial instruments may not be introduced expeditiously and the functions of the capital market may not be fully utilized, further weakening the international competitiveness of the Japanese markets. In addition, if regulations continue to severely restrict the activities of the institutions offering financial products, this may leave little room for the financial institutions to exercise creativity and, in the end, even discourage them from doing so. In practice, the regulations were applied with a certain degree of flexibility to avoid impairment of market functions. In order to strengthen the competitiveness of the Japanese markets, however, it is essential to resolutely relax or remove existing regulations to allow the private sector to fully exercise its creativity.

It then becomes important that market participants be held responsible for their own actions and market discipline be respected, and also that comprehensive rules be made that are applied to the entire market to ensure the adequate functioning of the market mechanism. Such market rules can be summarized conceptually into the following two categories.

The first type is rules that financial businesses in general -- for example, banks, securities companies, insurance companies, and investment trusts -- must observe in their transactions with customers. These include rules that provide for adequate explanation of the risks involved in a certain product in accordance with the customer's level of knowledge and experience, or for a strict separation of the customers' assets from the institution's assets. The second type is rules pertaining to disclosure and those that prohibit unfair trades. The basis of investor protection is to disclose information that enables investors to make rational decisions about investment. With such disclosure, all responsibility for the investment decisions will lie with the investors. It is thus necessary to enhance public disclosure, while considering for which instruments investor protection should be provided.

Besides these two types of rules, prudential regulations will need to be imposed on banks which participate in the settlement system. This is because failure of one bank might trigger the materialization of systemic risk, disrupting the entire financial system. However, if the prudential regulations are applied too rigorously, banks may be put at a major disadvantage vis-a-vis other financial institutions. Therefore, banking regulations are now being reviewed so that they encourage further efforts by banks themselves.

These rules and regulations should not control the details of the actions of financial institutions. Instead, their aim is to guarantee free and self-reliant behavior of financial institutions within the minimum necessary framework. Relaxation or removal of all unnecessary regulations within that framework should promote competition among financial institutions, improving the quality of financial services available to users in Japan and abroad.

C. The Future of the Japanese Financial Markets
Before concluding, I would also like to discuss the Bank's views regarding the future of Japan's markets, about which questions are often raised.

First of all, in light of the experience of the Big Bang in the United Kingdom, some anticipate that when the market reform is accomplished, Japanese financial institutions might end up being acquired by foreign interests. It is extremely difficult to forecast whether this will happen in Japan and to what extent it will occur. However, whoever will be the providers of financial services, what is most important is to establish financial markets which efficiently supply diverse financial services to the people and which thereby provide the foundation for the sound development of the national economy. Even if attempts are made to protect domestic financial institutions by means of market regulation, the cost of that protection will have to be borne by the people, if the financial institutions lack international competitiveness. This would reduce the international competitiveness of Japanese firms and, in the end, might only shackle the economic development of Japan.

Following the Big Bang in the United Kingdom, the London market grew once again and consolidated its status as a global market. It is true that in the process, capital of various origins found its way into British financial institutions. This, however, occurred because the London market had the capacity to create new financial techniques, and obviously, the subsequent revitalization of the market has contributed to the development of the British economy.

In the end, financial institutions seem to have no choice but to reinforce their financial strength and enhance their competitiveness to survive tough competition. I strongly expect that financial institutions in Japan will further strengthen their competitiveness through efforts to reform themselves, and I am convinced that they remain full of determination in this respect.

Another concern in Japan has been that if deregulation proceeds further, many of the small and medium-sized financial institutions will find their business base taken over by the larger institutions. Looking at the situation in Europe and the United States, however, I feel that there is a tendency for financial institutions to become specialized in the present financial environment. While it is true that some financial institutions might seek to provide comprehensive financial services, they will not be able to survive the severe competition by merely expanding the scale and scope of their operations. Those institutions will also have to develop areas or niches in which they can be competitive to secure the base for their existence. It is thus strongly expected that each financial institution will advance its know-how and expertise in its particular areas of strength so as to provide quality financial services. While the market reform in Japan will thus intensify competition among financial institutions, I am of the view that it will not directly cause the small and medium-sized financial institutions to lose their business bases.

V. Conclusion
The reform of the financial markets involves numerous issues besides relaxation and removal of existing regulations and improvement of the institutional framework of the legal, tax, and accounting systems. Review of public financing and adequate regulation and supervision, for example, are important considerations. The revision of the Bank of Japan Law should also be perceived as part of the process of reform of the Japanese financial markets and the financial system.

With regard to the revision of the Bank of Japan Law, a bill to amend the entire Law was submitted to the Diet in March following intense deliberations by the Central Bank Study Group, an advisory panel to the Prime Minister, and by the Financial System Research Council, an advisory committee to the Minister of Finance. The bill aims at establishing a new central bank system founded on the two basic principles of independence and transparency. Underlying the amendment proposal is the perception that in order to improve the efficacy and flexibility of monetary policy amid the changes occurring in the global environment surrounding the Japanese financial markets, which I have discussed today, the legislation based on which the Bank of Japan operates must be appropriate for a central bank in the new age.

I strongly hope that the bill will have a smooth passage following Diet deliberations. At the same time, we at the Bank of Japan are determined to strengthen our efforts to reform the Bank to ensure appropriate policy and operational management.

In closing, I would like to ask for your continued understanding and cooperation. Thank you.",,Neutral,0.5722215176,,
"Jun. 27, 1997","Speech given by Yasuo Matsushita, Governor of the Bank of Japan, to the Yomiuri International Economic Society in Tokyo on June 27, 1997 (A New Framework of Monetary Policy under the New Bank of Japan Law)","Introduction
As you are all aware, the Diet passed the new Bank of Japan Law on June 11, which will come into effect on April 1, 1998.

It has been the perennial wish of the Bank of Japan to revise the current Bank of Japan Law, which was legislated during World War II, to accommodate the significant changes that have occurred in the economic and financial environment and to make the Law able to withstand future changes in the environment. Revision of the Law was also indispensable for rebuilding the entire Japanese financial system so as to meet global standards. This revision built on the two principles of independence and transparency is thus a notable step in the 115 years of the Bank's history and also for reforming the financial system of Japan.

The Bank of Japan Law holds great significance as one of the basic laws governing Japan's economic and financial activities. Looking back, this important revision was achieved in approximately one year from the start of discussions in spring 1996 owing to the support and efforts of many people, including Prime Minister Hashimoto, Finance Minister Mitsuzuka, and other government officials, members of parliament, and members of the Advisory Group on the Central Bank (an advisory panel to the Prime Minister) and the Financial System Research Council (an advisory committee to the Minister of Finance). Many words of encouragement as well as criticism were heard from the financial and business circles and the general public, including perhaps some of you who are here today. I would like to take this opportunity to express, on behalf of the Bank, our heartfelt gratitude to all.

Naturally, the reform of the Bank of Japan is not consummated merely by the revision of the Law. We at the Bank of Japan believe it essential that we continue our efforts to conduct appropriate policy and operational management, cognizant of the responsibilities entrusted to us by the people. We are determined to promote, in line with the aim of the revision of the Law, wide-ranging reforms to further improve the transparency of policy management and the efficiency of the Bank's operational management.

Today, I would first like to discuss recent monetary and economic conditions and the Bank's current monetary policy management. I will then explain the new framework of monetary policy under the new Law and how the Bank intends to manage monetary policy.

II. Recent Monetary and Economic Conditions and Monetary Policy Management
A. Recent Economic and Price Developments and Monetary Policy Management
I would like to start with the recent domestic economic condition.

Japan's economy is currently at a phase in which the downward pressures of fiscal tightening appear strongest, with personal consumption and housing investment declining in reaction to the stepped-up demand before the consumption tax rate was raised. However, in view of the firm developments in production and improvements in corporate profits and household income, the Bank judges that the economy continues to follow a moderate recovery trend. The results of the June Tankan -- Short-term Economic Survey of Enterprises in Japan, which were released two days ago, for the most part confirmed this view.

The question is whether the virtuous circle of demand, production, and income, which has been developing steadily, will keep its momentum and whether, as a result, the economy will gain further momentum for a self-sustained recovery despite the downward pressures of fiscal tightening. The key to this will be developments in business fixed investment and personal consumption, which, according to the Tankan results and other indicators, can be analyzed as follows.

Firms' projections of revenues and profits and their plans for fixed investment indicate that recovery in business conditions will remain moderate for smaller firms, especially for those in the non-manufacturing sector. However, for firms as a whole, revenues and profits continue to be on an upward trend, especially for major firms, supported by increasing exports and buoyant demand for information technology-related goods and services. Fixed investment plans are also being revised upward. If this trend continues, the recovery in business conditions can be expected to spread to smaller firms.

Employment and income are showing moderate but steady improvement, and bonus payments in summer 1997 are likely to enjoy a sizable rise. While personal consumption will inevitably be affected by the rise in the consumption tax rate and by the discontinuation of the special tax reduction, it is unlikely that the trend of recovery will be hampered considering the improvements in the income environment.

Thus, the virtuous circle, generated by a recovery in private demand, is still at work. The Bank is, therefore, of the view that the current slowdown in demand will only be temporary and that it is likely that the economic recovery will continue. It is, however, necessary to continue to monitor closely consumer behavior and business activity.

Prices remained virtually unchanged in April and May after the immediate effects of the rise in the consumption tax rate are discounted. The Bank will continue to monitor price developments closely, but expects prices to remain stable for some time, reflecting the recent appreciation of the yen and stabilized crude oil prices.

In the management of current monetary policy, the Bank will continue to monitor economic developments closely, placing emphasis on further strengthening the foundations of the economic recovery.

B. The Thinking Behind the Bank's Easy Stance of Monetary Policy
I have heard various questions and criticisms with regard to the easy stance of monetary policy, which the Bank has continued with a view to strengthening the foundations of the economic recovery. Therefore, I would next like to share with you the thinking behind the current stance of monetary policy.

First, there is the question of why the Bank has not changed its policy stance since 1995, when it lowered the official discount rate to 0.5 percent, despite a gradual recovery of the economy.

Indeed, compared to 1995, concern about a deflationary spiral has subsided and economic activity has improved significantly. The purpose of the drastic monetary easing measures was to prevent an occurrence of a deflationary spiral, to strengthen the confidence of firms and households in the economic outlook, and to thereby place the Japanese economy on a path of self-sustained recovery.

As you are aware, the Japanese economy is faced with the medium- to long-term challenges of overcoming the aftereffects of the bursting of the economic ""bubble"" and reforming its industrial structure. The economy has therefore had to achieve a recovery while addressing these weighty challenges. Further, since the latter half of 1996, measures for fiscal consolidation have been implemented, including a reducing of public-sector investment and a raising of the consumption tax rate. In order for the economy to attain noninflationary, sustainable growth under such circumstances, the forces of the self-sustained recovery achieved in the private sector need to be further strengthened. It is therefore the Bank's judgment that, at this point, it is necessary to monitor economic developments carefully bearing this in mind.

Second, there has been criticism that, from the viewpoint of income distribution, the current low interest rates are putting the general public at a disadvantage. The Bank is fully aware of the difficult situation faced by those households which depend heavily on interest income. However, various types of income, whether it be wages, interest, or pensions, are distributed from the total output produced by economic activity. Therefore, without growth of the total output, sources of such income will not be generated. If the policy interest rate is raised before economic activity is sufficiently revitalized and, as a result, the economy is adversely affected, long-term interest rates may actually decline. It will then be difficult to say how the average level of short- and long-term deposit interest rates will be affected. What I wish to emphasize is that in order for the overall level of interest rates to rise, there must have been the requisite improvement in the economic activity.

Third, there have been concerns that low interest rates may encourage an outflow of domestic funds. In discussing this point, it must be remembered that the relationship between cross-border interest rate differentials and capital flows under the present floating exchange rate system differs from that under the fixed exchange rate system.

Under the latter, there is no foreign exchange risk. Therefore, funds tend to flow to economies with higher interest rates. This is precisely why, under that system, strict regulation of capital flows was necessary.

Under the floating exchange rate system, however, such capital flows do not necessarily occur. Even if one attempts to profit from a differential between domestic and overseas interest rates, the profit can be wiped out instantly with even a slight shift in the exchange rate. For example, if overseas interest rates rise, widening interest rate differentials, capital outflows may initially occur, causing the foreign currency to appreciate and the domestic currency to depreciate. After some time, however, expectations will emerge that the value of the foreign currency will start to decline. At that point, the benefits of investing in the foreign currency will have decreased significantly. Thus, when foreign exchange risk is taken into consideration, a situation in which the expected rate of return on foreign currency investment is substantially higher than that on domestic investment cannot be sustained.

Under the floating exchange rate system, therefore, exchange rate fluctuations will apply the brakes to any one-sided capital flow. The long-term interest rate differential between Japan and the United States has been around 2 to 4 percent in recent years, and has widened in this time. It is true that during this time investment in foreign bonds has increased. Yet this has not depleted funds in Japan or caused domestic interest rates to remain at a high level.

With global capital flows as active as they are today, the mechanism of the floating exchange rate system will function only more expeditiously. In other words, the speed of market adjustments has accelerated. What is critical in these circumstances is the occurrence of a capital flight, which may be triggered by a loss of market confidence in a country's economic policy management resulting from an inflation or recession in that country. In order to prevent this from occurring in Japan today, it is essential to strengthen the foundations of the economic recovery and to achieve noninflationary, sustainable growth.

In this connection, some argue that the revision of the Foreign Exchange and Foreign Trade Control Law, together with the low interest rates, may accelerate capital outflow. The Bank intends to monitor carefully the effects of the revision on the markets. However, as I have just explained, the Bank believes that there is little possibility of a disruptive capital outflow occurring simply as a result of the interest rate differentials between Japan and abroad. Rather, a more serious problem to consider would be the emergence of a ""transaction flight."" Should market participants decide for certain reasons that overseas markets are more attractive and beneficial to the conducting of transactions, even financial and capital transactions between residents, which have conventionally been conducted in Japan -- for example, securities transactions between domestic firms and households -- may shift overseas. Although this will not induce an outflow of capital, transactions will be carried out abroad and the subsequent business opportunities will be transferred overseas. Should this trend continue, it might lead to a hollowing out of Japan's financial markets. This is why the ""Big Bang"" deregulation package must be implemented apace with the revision of the Foreign Exchange and Foreign Trade Control Law, to enhance the attractiveness of domestic financial markets and services.

III. The New Framework of Monetary Policy under the New Bank of Japan Law
To summarize what I have said so far, the Bank of Japan is managing monetary policy with a view to placing the Japanese economy on a path of noninflationary, sustainable growth.

While this has always been the objective of monetary policy under the current Bank of Japan Law, it is stipulated more explicitly by the new Law, which will come into effect on April 1, 1998. Various revisions have also been incorporated in the new Law to ensure the achievement of this objective. I would, therefore, like to discuss the new framework of monetary policy under the new Bank of Japan Law and how we intend to make use of the new framework, firstly with regard to the objectives, secondly the instruments, and finally the management of monetary policy, including the decision-making procedures.

A. Monetary Policy Objectives
1. Price stability
I would first like to discuss the objectives of monetary policy.

The new Bank of Japan Law stipulates that the objective of monetary policy is ""to contribute to the sound development of the national economy through the pursuit of price stability."" The sound development of the national economy is a common objective of all economic policies. As the objective of monetary policy is to contribute to the achievement of this ultimate objective through price stability, its direct objective will be to ensure price stability. Price stability, together with the stability of the financial system, is a precondition for money to smoothly perform its intrinsic functions. As the issuer and controller of money, maintenance of price stability is an inherent role of the central bank.

It is, however, not easy to define price stability. There are diverse types of price indicators: for example, the Consumer Price Index, Wholesale Price Indexes, and the GDP deflator. Each of these has its limitation, such as the range of items covered or the timing of release. Further, many studies have been conducted more recently on the possibility that these indicators offer a substantially biased measurement of prices. Even with a perfectly reliable price indicator, there will still be disparate views regarding what specific percentage of price increases would be acceptable.

Thus, it is difficult to define specifically what is meant by price stability. We at the Bank will continue to study this issue, including the interpretation of price indices. It becomes clearer, however, if the matter is considered from the viewpoint of the implications of price stability for economic activity.

""Prices,"" sometimes referred to as ""prices in general,"" are the average level of the prices of individual goods and services, and serve as a tool to measure the relative rise or fall in the price of individual goods and services. Therefore, if prices in general were to fluctuate significantly, firms and households would not be able to conduct efficient investment and consumption activity.

For example, in an inflationary economy, even if the price of a firm's product rises, the firm will not be able to judge whether this will bring about increased earnings in the future, or whether it merely reflects a rise in prices in general with the price increase being offset by an increase in wages and cost of raw materials. In such an economy, firms will, in the long term, inevitably become cautious with their investments. Furthermore, when there are concerns about inflation, people will tend to curtail their spending. The same situation may arise in the case of a deflationary economy. One possible example was the Japanese economy in 1995, when there were concerns about a deflationary spiral.

This line of thinking leads to the conclusion that ensuring price stability means maintaining a situation in which firms and households need not be concerned about a continuing rise or fall in prices in the future when planning their investment and consumption.

2. The relationship between price stability and the economy
Having defined price stability, there may still be questions about the relationship between price stability and other important policy objectives or economic variables. For example, should we not care about the economy and economic growth as long as prices remain stable? What is the relationship between prices and foreign exchange rates or asset prices?

First, with regard to the relationship between prices and the economy, it is true that in the short term, it seems as if higher economic growth could be realized if a certain level of price increase were allowed. However, it has recently been proved both theoretically and empirically that this effect will only be temporary.

If such a process is repeated, the economy may well fall into an intractable situation of stagflation, in which the economy falls back into a recession but high inflation remains. This was the economic disease that plagued the industrialized countries of Europe and the United States from the mid-1970s to the early 1980s. In the light of that experience, there is a common understanding today that price stability is a precondition for sustainable economic growth.

Second, how are foreign exchange rates and asset prices to be considered in the context of monetary policy management? They are important factors that require due attention. However, if their stability is made a direct objective of monetary policy, the stability of the domestic economy and of prices in general may be undermined. This is because land prices and exchange rates reflect certain factors which prices in general do not. Specifically, land prices incorporate changes in the productivity of land and in the expected rate of return. Exchange rates, in the long term, are adjusted by the market mechanism in accordance with the differentials between domestic and overseas inflation rates, or in other words, changes in the purchasing power parities. Any attempt to control such factors forcibly through macroeconomic policies will most likely cause distortions in other sectors of the economy.

Needless to say, fluctuations in exchange rates and asset prices will affect the economy in various ways. It has been a valuable lesson of the bubble economy that significant fluctuations in asset prices may be a sign of some irregularities in economic activity or excessive expectations of economic entities. Therefore, while it would not be appropriate to attempt any rigid control of asset prices and exchange rates, the Bank will pay due attention to developments in them in managing monetary policy aimed at achieving the objective of price stability.

B. Monetary Policy Instruments
Let me next discuss the instruments of monetary policy under the new Bank of Japan Law.

Economic textbooks often refer to (1) the official discount rate, (2) open market operations, and (3) reserve requirements as the three major monetary policy instruments. These are in fact the means with which the Bank of Japan implements monetary policy, and this will remain unchanged under the new Law. The revised Law, however, incorporates the following changes.

First, the new Law explicitly stipulates that ""guidelines for money market control through various measures such as buying and selling of bills or bonds"" -- that is, the Bank's basic policy for open market operations, or in other words, the Bank's policy for the guiding of money market rates -- are to be decided by the Bank of Japan's Policy Board, while in the current Law, there is no explicit stipulation concerning such policy.

Second, while the current Law stipulates that determination and altering of reserve requirements must be approved by the Minister of Finance, the new Law abolishes this approval system.

With these changes, all the three instruments of monetary policy -- including official discount rate policy, which is already stipulated by the current Law as a matter for decision by the Policy Board -- will be spelt out explicitly as matters to be decided by the Policy Board.

Reserve requirements have been altered less frequently as the means of open market operations developed. I would therefore like to discuss in detail the historical background and the Bank's view of official discount rate changes and of the guiding of money market rates, with emphasis on how the Bank will utilize these two means of implementing monetary policy.

1. Relationship between official discount rate changes and the guiding of money market rates
For many years, monetary policy was in most cases implemented in Japan by changing the official discount rate. This was because the financial markets were not sufficiently developed and, under these circumstances, deposit interest rates and lending rates were linked to the official discount rate.

The situation changed gradually from the 1980s. The financial markets began to grow both in quality and quantity, with massive issuance of government securities and introduction of new financial instruments such as certificates of deposit (CDs) and commercial paper (CP). As a result, interest rates started to fluctuate freely reflecting the supply and demand conditions for funds, and accordingly, an environment was established in which the effects of monetary policy would permeate via market interest rates.

In response to such changes in the financial markets, the Bank has devised various changes to its monetary policy management. For example, in the buying and selling of bills and bonds, the Bank abolished the system of conducting operations at the rate quoted by the Bank, and adopted a more transparent bidding system. The Bank also improved the efficiency of its market operations by shortening the lag between the announcement of operations and the settlement of funds. In 1991, the Bank abolished window guidance, a method in which the Bank gave direct guidance to financial institutions regarding the amount by which they increased their lendings, and provided for an environment in which the functions of interest rates could be used to influence the behavior of financial institutions.

In addition, in 1994, deregulation of deposit interest rates was completed. This meant that the official discount rate no longer performed the role of directly bringing changes to deposit interest rates and lending rates, and instead, the significance of the guiding of money market rates increased.

Consequently, on March 31, 1995, the Bank introduced a new system to utilize the guiding of money market rates as a means of monetary policy which is, by itself, as significant as the official discount rate. This is a system whereby the Bank publicly announces its policy for market operations after it has been approved by the Policy Board. The policy is stated with regard to the guiding level of overnight call money rates, the Bank's target rate in market operations. For example, the Bank might state that it ""expects that the call money rate will remain on average slightly below the official discount rate.""

While this method of monetary policy implementation had already taken root in the United States, it was the first attempt for Japan back in March 1995. At the time of this first attempt, it so happened that Germany had lowered its official discount rate a day earlier, and it cannot be denied that the market could not quite understand and assimilate the Bank's policy intention. The Bank's use of the guiding of money market rates, however, has gradually gained understanding and has taken root in Japan as well. In fact, when the Bank encouraged a decline in the market rates on July 7, 1995, the policy intent permeated smoothly through the market without causing any confusion.

The provision of the new Law stating that the policy for the guiding of money market rates be determined by the Policy Board reinforces the recent emphasis placed by the Bank on the market mechanism.

What significance, then, will the official discount rate have in this age of marketization? Central banks overseas hold various views as to the relationship between official discount rate changes and the guiding of money market rates, and it is difficult to arrive at a single conclusion.

However, examples overseas suggest that official discount rate changes continue to play an important role even in this age of economic and financial marketization and interest rate liberalization. Their function is to communicate plainly to everybody the changes in monetary policy. In order to maintain the efficacy of monetary policy amid the progress of marketization, it becomes even more necessary to win public understanding of and confidence in the central bank's economic outlook and the thinking behind its monetary policy management. In this regard, the easy-to-understand announcement effects of the official discount rate are valuable for monetary policy management based on the functioning of the market mechanism.

I am sometimes asked which of the two would be employed first, the guiding of money market rates or official discount rate change. However, there is no fixed rule as to which should be implemented first. In some cases, the Bank may change the level it has set for the guiding of money market rates several times before changing the official discount rate, and in other cases, the Bank may first strongly indicate its policy intention by changing the official discount rate, and then guide the money market rates accordingly.

For the reasons I have just explained, the Bank believes it necessary to make effective use of both official discount rate changes and the guiding of money market rates.

C. Monetary Policy Management
1. Strengthening of the functions of the Policy Board
I would now like to discuss monetary policy management, focusing on the decision-making process of monetary policy.

The new Bank of Japan Law incorporates major revisions aimed at strengthening the functions of the Policy Board, the Bank of Japan's highest decision-making body.

First, the composition of the Board is altered significantly. The current Policy Board consists of seven members: the Governor of the Bank of Japan; four appointed members; and two government members without voting rights, representing the Ministry of Finance and the Economic Planning Agency. The new Policy Board, however, will consist of nine members: the Governor and the two Deputy Governors of the Bank of Japan and six deliberative members.

The main features of the changes are that, first, there will be no government members on the Board. Second, while the current appointed members must be selected from each of the four fields of city banking, regional banking, commerce and industry, and agriculture, the new deliberative members can be selected from among a much broader population, without any restriction on the fields they represent, so long as they are experts, including those on economy or finance. Third, in order to ensure interactive linkage between monetary policy decision-making and the Bank's business operations, the number of members from the management of the Bank is increased from one to three. A balance is to be struck, however, by appointing six deliberative members so that the three members from the management will not constitute the majority.

Also, the powers of the Policy Board, which remained somewhat ambiguous under the current law, are clarified. One example is the explicit stipulation of the three instruments of monetary policy as matters for decision by the Policy Board, which I discussed earlier.

In addition to these revisions, we at the Bank will do our best to ensure that the Policy Board can fully function.

For example, meetings of the executive are currently organized at the Bank of Japan pursuant to the Bank's by-laws. The meetings are attended by the Governor, the Deputy Governor, and the Executive Directors, and, as the executive body of the Bank, meets to discuss important matters related to the Bank's daily business operations and to deliberate on matters on which it needs to consult with the Policy Board. The meetings thus by no means represent decision-making opportunities. However, the holding of the meetings has invited criticism that the Bank perhaps has two decision-making processes. Under the new Law, therefore, the meetings will be abolished to prevent any misunderstanding regarding the procedures of monetary policy decision-making.

As a result, meetings of the executive will not deliberate on monetary control issues before they are discussed by the Policy Board. The entire procedure related to monetary policy, from judging the economic and financial conditions to policy decision-making, will be concentrated at the Policy Board.

2. Holding of regular Policy Board meetings on monetary control matters
With the powers of the Policy Board strengthened in this manner, the new Law provides for regular meetings of the Policy Board on monetary control matters as well as disclosure of summaries of discussions and transcripts (detailed records of discussions) of the meetings.

The main aim of holding regular Policy Board meetings on monetary control matters is to ensure the stability of the financial markets.

Currently, the Policy Board meets every Tuesday and Friday. However, the holding of ad hoc meetings means that there is the possibility that policy changes might be made at any time. That being the case, the markets inevitably become overly sensitive to various kinds of information, such as daily movements in economic indicators and individual statements by relevant people. In fact, on quite a few occasions, one piece of information has triggered speculation over monetary policy changes, leading to market disruption.

It is indeed an intrinsic function of the financial markets to assimilate various kinds of information and to reflect them in the formation of interest rates. In order for this function to be played out in the most stable and efficient manner, however, it is important that undue speculation and market disruption be avoided. This will also be conducive to improving the efficacy of monetary policy.

The new system of holding regular Board meetings on monetary control matters and of announcing the schedule of such meetings in advance has been devised based on such considerations.

In determining the frequency of these regular meetings, due thought must be given to ensuring the timeliness of policy implementation as well as market stabilization. Although there is no need to preclude the possibility of ad hoc meetings, monetary policy decisions should in principle be made at the regular meetings in keeping with the purpose of the new system. If we look at the practices of other countries, the U.S. Federal Open Market Committee meets the least often at eight times a year, the Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of England once a month, and the Central Bank Council of the German Bundesbank twice a month. The Bank will continue to study how best to run the Board meetings by considering such examples overseas and the aim of the new system.

If I may add a word here, Policy Board meetings other than the regular meetings on monetary control matters will be held as necessary. Apart from determination of monetary policy, the Policy Board will also discuss and decide on a number of matters, such as issues related to the financial and payments systems as well as those related to the operational and organizational management of the Bank. The Policy Board currently meets twice weekly, and it is likely to meet frequently under the new Law as well. What is of special note in the new system is that, while Policy Board meetings will be held frequently, the opportunities to hold intensive discussions and decide on monetary control matters are specified.

3. Disclosure of summaries of discussions and transcripts of Policy Board meetings
I would now like to explain the new disclosure system of summaries of discussions and transcripts of the regular Policy Board meetings on monetary control matters.

One of the main principles underlying the revision of the Bank of Japan Law is improvement of the transparency of monetary policy. To this end, the new Law provides for the disclosure of the summaries of discussions and the transcripts of the regular Policy Board meetings on monetary control matters.

Disclosure of the summaries of discussions is aimed at gaining more fully the understanding and confidence of the market and the public regarding the Bank's basic thinking underlying its monetary policy. The Bank, therefore, intends to prepare accurate and clear-cut summaries of the Board's discussions on monetary and economic conditions and on monetary policy.

The difficult issue is the timing of disclosure. Considering the purpose of the disclosure, it is desirable that the summaries of discussions be disclosed at the earliest possible moment. Yet, it would only be counterproductive should the disclosure invite market speculation or disruption. For example, let us assume that at a meeting held at the beginning of a month, heated discussions are held on the projected movement of an indicator which is to be released at the end of the month. If the summary of such discussions were disclosed before the release of the indicator, it might heighten speculation over future policy management. However, the summary should not be made ambiguous with the intention of avoiding such speculation. Therefore, the Bank will have to consider the earliest disclosure that will not undermine market stability. In the United States, the summary of discussions is disclosed approximately one to one and a half months after the meeting, and in the United Kingdom, within six weeks. These timings probably reflect the central banks' desire to avoid undue speculation over discussions and policy decisions at future meetings.

The transcripts of discussions at the meetings will have a somewhat different role from the summaries, although both are meant to enhance the transparency of monetary policy. While the summaries of discussions seek to promote better understanding of current policy management, the transcripts are a tool to enable a detailed review at a later date, as necessary, of the Policy Board's policy management at a certain point in time. On the one hand, due attention must be given to ensuring that the disclosure of the transcripts does not hamper free and frank discussions at Policy Board meetings. On the other hand, however, if the disclosure is overly delayed, the significance of the disclosure may be greatly reduced. With these points in mind, the Bank intends to establish an effective disclosure system that makes the Bank sufficiently accountable to the public.

The Bank has, to date, endeavored to explain as clearly as possible the basic thinking behind its monetary policy management at regular press conferences, before the Diet, in publications, in speeches, and at various other opportunities. Disclosure of the transcripts and the summaries of discussions of the Policy Board are added to these measures under the new Law, and this will equip the Bank of Japan with means that go beyond global standards to ensure the transparency of monetary policy. We at the Bank intend to make effective use of these means to win even greater public understanding of and confidence in the Bank's policy management.

4. Relationship between the central bank and the Government
Lastly, I would like to discuss the relationship between the Bank of Japan and the Government. The new Law allows Government representatives to attend Policy Board meetings on monetary control matters and to express their views when necessary. It also grants the Government representatives the right to make policy proposals regarding monetary control matters, including requests to postpone the Board's vote on policies. Some suggest that these provisions will constrain the independence of the central bank. We at the Bank, however, do not take that view.

First of all, the monetary policy of the Bank of Japan is designed to contribute to the sound development of the national economy in conjunction with the economic policy of the Government. The Bank therefore needs to ensure adequate communication with the Government in managing monetary policy, although the policy must be decided by the Bank on its own responsibility and judgment.

What is important is that the relationship between the Bank and the Government in the determination of monetary policy be clear and transparent, and therefore under the new system, the Government's views and the discussions and votes on Government proposals will be disclosed in the summaries of discussions. In addition, although the Government representatives have the right to ""request"" a postponement of the Board's vote, they do not have the right to ""instruct."" Whether to postpone the vote on policies as requested will be determined by a vote by the Policy Board.

This new system is designed carefully from the viewpoint of ensuring the autonomy of the central bank in monetary policy management while also ensuring adequate communication between the Bank and the Government. We at the Bank intend to establish a clear, transparent, and constructive relationship with the Government to serve the purpose of the new system, believing that such a relationship will not interfere with the central bank's autonomy.

IV. Conclusion
I hope that I have been able to make clear how specifically the two main principles of the new Bank of Japan Law, independence and transparency, will be embedded in the new central bank system.

As I stated at the outset, the Bank intends to implement all possible measures as part of the Bank's self-reform even before the new Law is effected, to accommodate the aims of the new Law. The Bank is currently studying a concrete mechanism for holding regular Policy Board meetings on monetary control matters and for disclosing the summaries of discussions at those meetings, which will be implemented as soon as preparations are completed.

I wish to conclude by asking for your continued understanding and support. Thank you very much.",,Positive,0.8077754974,,
"Aug. 29, 1997",Foreword by the Governor,"This article is the Governor's foreword to the Bank of Japan's ""Annual Review 1997"" published on August 29, 1997.

August 1997
Bank of Japan

It is a pleasure to be able to bring to you the Bank of Japan Annual Review 1997, which reviews the monetary and economic developments in Japan as well as summarizes the Bank's activities in fiscal 1996.

Fiscal 1996 saw some significant progress with regard to both the Japanese economy and the financial system. It also marked a historic year for the Bank of Japan, with the enactment of the new Bank of Japan Law, which is to come into effect on April 1, 1998.

The Japanese economy, after a pause in early spring 1995, resumed its recovery around the end of 1995, partly due to strong monetary and fiscal support, as well as the depreciation of the yen. The virtuous circle of demand, production, and income has gradually gained strength since the second half of 1996. There remain, however, factors moderating the pace of recovery, such as the effects of fiscal consolidation and the persistent pressures for structural adjustments.

In the financial system, Japanese financial institutions disposed of a significant amount of nonperforming loans through write-offs and provisioning in fiscal 1996. Moreover, in June, a package of financial reform bills, including measures to address the jusen problem and to reform the deposit insurance system, was legislated. Meanwhile, failed financial institutions were resolved without delay, and the Bank of Japan, with full commitment to restoring and ensuring the stability and sound functioning of the financial system, closely cooperated in the resolution schemes, providing central bank funds when such funds were indispensable for avoiding systemic risk.

Financial system reform has also been a subject of heated discussion since the ""Big Bang"" deregulation package for Japan was proposed by Prime Minister Hashimoto in November 1996. Intensive and concrete discussions have been held on numerous issues including the relaxation and removal of existing regulations and the improvement of the frameworks of the legal and accounting systems. I strongly believe that the reform is indispensable to the establishment of an internationally competitive financial market, to thereby prevent the hollowing out of the market.

An important topic for the Bank was the enactment of the new Bank of Japan Law. The bill submitted by the government to revise the existing Bank of Japan Law was passed by the National Diet on June 11, 1997. The new Bank of Japan Law will become effective on April 1, 1998. The enactment of the new Law was an event of major significance in the 115-year history of the Bank. The revision of central bank law, along with the reform of the government's supervision and regulation of financial institutions, will constitute the basis of a major reform of the financial system of Japan.

The new Bank of Japan Law clearly states that the Bank's goals are to pursue price stability, thereby contributing to the sound development of the national economy, and to ensure smooth settlement of funds among financial institutions, thereby contributing to the maintenance of an orderly financial system. The Law also establishes a framework to the central bank based on the two principles of ""independence"" and ""transparency."" These principles represent the ideas that monetary policy should be determined independently by a politically neutral Policy Board of the central bank and that disclosure of policy making processes is essential in order that the central bank be accountable to, and thereby gain the support of, the public and markets. These ideas are commonly shared in the recent reform of central banks in major countries.

Independence of the central bank depends in good part on how the new Law is put into practice. Therefore, we are determined to continue our efforts to ensure the transparency of monetary policy management and the efficiency of the Bank's operational management under the new Law.

In this Annual Review 1997, a detailed analysis of monetary and economic developments in Japan is provided in the ""Annual Review of Monetary and Economic Developments."" The Bank of Japan's policy measures and activities are explained specifically in ""Major Decisions by the Policy Board"" and ""Developments in Bank of Japan Activities."" This issue also includes a preliminary English translation of the new Bank of Japan Law. Articles from this issue are provided on the Bank of Japan Internet Web site, as part of the Bank's efforts to improve its accountability.

I hope that you will find the Annual Review 1997 informative, and that it will prove useful in promoting your understanding of the Japanese economy and the role and activities of the Bank of Japan.",,Positive,0.6798011661,,
"Nov. 5, 1997","Speech given by Yasuo Matsushita, Governor of the Bank of Japan, to the Research Institute of Japan in Tokyo on November 5, 1997 (Recent Monetary and Economic Conditions and the Bank of Japan's Monetary Policy Management)"," Introduction
It is a great honor to be invited by the Research Institute of Japan to address this distinguished audience.

It has been one year since I last attended this gathering in November 1996.Looking back at the economic developments in Japan over the past year, economic growth temporarily accelerated from the latter half of 1996 through the spring of 1997, helped to some extent by increased demand ahead of the rise in the consumption tax rate in fiscal 1997. Since April this year, however, economic growth has been decelerating partly reflecting the lingering effects of the rise in the consumption tax rate. During this period, business sentiment seems to have become more cautious. Today, I would like to give views of the Bank of Japan on the present condition of and on the outlook for the Japanese economy. I will also discuss the Bank's thinking behind its monetary policy management.

I would then like to use the remaining time to discuss the Bank's views on some of the comments and questions the Bank has been receiving recently concerning the prolonged easy money policy, by which the official discount rate has been maintained at 0.5 percent for more than two years. Through my explanation, I hope to gain your better understanding on the Bank's aims in its monetary policy management.

II. Recent Monetary and Economic Conditions and the Bank's Monetary Policy Management
A. The Present Condition of and the Outlook for the Domestic Economy
Let me first discuss the domestic economic condition. Japan's economic growth has been decelerating since April 1997 partly reflecting the impact of the rise in the consumption tax rate that took place that month. In addition to the continuing decrease in public investment since autumn 1996, household spending such as personal consumption and housing investment has also dropped significantly since April 1997. As regards personal consumption, outlays on services such as those provided by the travel industry have been increasing moderately. However, outlays on goods have remained sluggish, as indicated by the sales of automobiles and household electric appliances as well as department store and chain store sales, although there are signs of a slight recovery. In addition, housing investment in terms of housing starts has declined more recently to 1.3 million from the 1.6 million per annum level that existed until spring 1997.

Several factors are responsible for such declines in household spending. The first is the strong and persistent reaction to the significantly increased demand ahead of the rise in the consumption tax rate. The increase in sales in the consumer goods- and housing-related industries from the latter half of 1996 had been taken as a strong indication of a sustainable recovery. In hindsight, those sales in fact included a significant amount of demand for household spending that would most likely have taken place later this year had the hike in the tax rate not been scheduled. The second factor, which to some extent had been anticipated, is the slowdown in the growth of real disposable income of households -- nominal income less tax payments and income erosion due to inflation -- following the rise in the consumption tax rate and the discontinuation of the special tax reduction. In addition, it seems undeniable that consumer confidence has weakened somewhat.

This decline in household expenditure since spring 1997, which was greater than had initially been anticipated, created excess inventories in certain sectors of consumer goods- and housing-related industries. These sectors have been required to reduce excess inventories since summer 1997 and, as a result, industrial production has leveled off. These developments in household expenditure and industrial production have resulted in a more cautious business sentiment.

The question is whether these developments in household expenditure and industrial production will undermine the momentum of economic recovery, or in other words, whether the declining personal consumption and housing investment will affect other demand items such as business fixed investment, thereby placing further downside pressure on the economy. The answer lies in the current strength of the self-sustained recovery in the private sector, and this is precisely what the Bank has carefully attended to over the past two years. As this is the most important factor when judging the outlook for the economy, I would like to give the Bank's views in some detail.

I will start off by discussing what is meant by the momentum of a self-sustained economic recovery, and then move on to the Bank's assessment of the present force of the self-sustained recovery as compared to that in 1995, when the Bank lowered the official discount rate to 0.5 percent. Lastly, I will use these points to examine the actual developments in demand and production, and assess the outlook for the economy.

The strength of self-sustained recovery of the private sector can be considered as the strength of the cyclical force inherent in the private sector. With this force, a build up of economic activity should lead to improved business sentiment, which, in turn, should lead to increased earnings and income. The rises in earnings and income should eventually encourage sustained growth in business fixed investment and personal consumption, respectively. When the strength of the self-sustained recovery, or the momentum of this cyclical force, is very weak, there is a risk that private-sector activity might begin to decline, particularly if unable to absorb the negative impact of such exogenous factors as external demand and fiscal policy. However, when there is a reasonable measure of strength in the self-sustained recovery, the inherent force can be expected to withstand the negative impact and put the economy back on the recovery path, despite being temporarily decelerated. In this case, the negative impact is contained and the private sector's economic outlook and investment attitude remain firm. As the pressures created by those exogenous factors subsequently subside, economic recovery should gradually become apparent.

I will now turn to my second point, that is, assessment of the strength of Japan's self-sustained recovery. The Japanese economy began to recover in late 1993 from a recession that followed the collapse of the ""bubble"" economy. In early 1995, however, the recovery paused, and there were even concerns about the occurrence of a deflationary spiral. In view of these circumstances, drastic monetary and fiscal policy measures were adopted. While the halt was directly attributable to the negative effects of the rapid appreciation of the yen, it was also due to the fact that the strength of the self-sustained recovery in the private sector was yet too weak to overcome the downward pressures from outside the private sector. It is true that the economy had been on a recovery trend since late 1993. However, we at the Bank judge that because firms' profitability as well as capacity utilization had remained at a low level, the shock of a sudden appreciation of the yen applied the brakes to the economic recovery.

The important issue now is how much strength there is in the recent economic recovery in Japan. Balance-sheet adjustment and adjustment of industrial structure are still in process. This being the case, we at the Bank do not believe that the self-sustained economic recovery has gained sufficient strength. This is precisely why we have maintained the official discount rate at a low level since September 1995. In the course of the gradual economic recovery over the past two years, however, the level of economic activity has doubtlessly been rising steadily, gradually adding to the strength of the self-sustained economic recovery.

Specifically, there has been some progress in balance-sheet adjustment and industrial restructuring as corporate profits continued to increase. The manufacturing sector, especially large manufacturers, have achieved a higher than average level of profitability, although the profitability of the nonmanufacturing sector remains low. According to the results of the ""Tankan -- Short-Term Economic Survey of Enterprises in Japan,"" firms feel that there have been declines in the excessiveness of production capacity and employment. This implies that while business fixed investment increased over the past two years, excessive accumulation of capital stock has been avoided. Judging from these points, the force of the self-sustained economic recovery has clearly strengthened compared to 1995, at which time there were concerns about a deflationary spiral.

Thirdly, I would like to discuss the outlook for demand, production, and income based on the aforementioned assessment of the self-sustained economic recovery.

As for final demand, personal consumption and housing investment continue to be sluggish in general and public investment is expected to follow a declining trend. Employment, however, continues to be on a trend of gradual recovery. Firms plan to increase the number of newly hired graduates in fiscal 1998 for the second consecutive year. Although the growth of the household sector's real disposable income is expected to slow, any substantial income erosion should be avoided owing to the increase in employment. Therefore, provided that there is no serious deterioration of consumer confidence, personal consumption should gradually move toward recovery as the initial impact of the rise in the consumption tax rate diminishes.

Meanwhile, net exports and business fixed investment continue to increase. Exports have increased significantly since the latter half of 1996, reflecting the depreciation of the yen until spring 1997. Imports, after having increased rapidly until mid-1996 due partly to a growth in imports from the overseas subsidiaries of Japanese manufacturers, have leveled off recently reflecting the depreciation of the yen.

Under these circumstances, the key issue for the time being is how the recent currency and financial instability in Southeast Asia will affect Japan's exports and imports and its economy as a whole. In view of the progress in the horizontal division of labor and expansion of trade and capital transactions between Japan and other Asian countries, this matter requires due attention.

If we take a look at Japan's trade with Asian countries, Japan's exports to Thailand have decreased significantly. However, there have not been any notable declines in exports to other neighboring countries. In addition, Japan's other export markets such as the United States maintain solid economic growth. On the foreign exchange market, the yen has appreciated against Southeast Asian currencies following their shift to a floating exchange rate system. However, the yen has, overall, remained in a stable range reflecting a gradual depreciation against the U.S. dollar. Thus, Japan's export environment as a whole continues to be favorable, and the currency and financial instability in Southeast Asia has, so far, not affected the fundamental trend of Japan's exports in any significant way.

In addition, Southeast Asian countries have been adopting various measures,some of which are internationally coordinated. On November 1, it was announced that the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and other international organizations have agreed on a financial package for Indonesia. In the foreign exchange markets, the monetary authorities of Japan, Singapore, and Indonesia have confirmed that they will cooperate to stabilize the Indonesian currency. The Bank of Japan strongly hopes that these and similar measures taken by other countries will soon restore monetary and financial stability in these countries and encourage a smooth economic adjustment. The Bank will continue to observe developments carefully.

With regard to business fixed investment, this is likely to continue to expand as a whole against the backdrop of sustained growth in corporate profits. Firms' projections of earnings in fiscal 1997 indicate that smaller nonmanufacturing firms anticipate a decline in profits for the first time in four years, strongly affected by a decline in public investment and in personal consumption. In the manufacturing sector, however, both large and smaller firms expect a continued rise in earnings and profits partly supported by solid export performance. In addition, large nonmanufacturing firms project sustained growth in profits following the favorable results in the manufacturing sector. Some of these profitable firms recently revised their earnings outlook downward because of the recent deceleration in domestic demand. However, on the whole, earnings and profits remain on an upward trend.

Against the backdrop of such developments in profits, overall investment plans in fiscal 1997 seem to be firm, especially in the manufacturing sector, although business fixed investment of smaller firms in the nonmanufacturing sector is expected to remain at a low level. In view of the aforementioned profit trend, the positive outlook for returns on investment, and the strong demand for information-related investment, it is fair to expect that business fixed investment will continue to increase.

As I have discussed, the Bank believes that the trend of economic recovery has not been undermined on account of gradual improvements in corporate profits, employment, and income. The Bank, therefore, expects that as personal consumption recovers, inventory adjustment will progress and the economy will resume a gradual recovery.

However, it is apparent that the virtuous circle in which increased production leads to larger income, which in turn stimulates spending, has weakened due in part to the effects of fiscal tightening. Should recovery in household expenditure be delayed, thus prolonging economic deceleration, the strength of the self-sustained economic recovery might be impaired. Bearing this possibility in mind, the Bank will watch cautiously economic developments in the coming days, including such points as the pace of recovery in personal consumption, progress in inventory adjustment, and developments in business and household confidence.

B. Recent Monetary Condition
Looking at the recent monetary condition in Japan, stock prices dropped sharply at the end of October amid a worldwide decline in stock markets triggered by the Hong Kong market. The impact on the prices seems to have subsided in the markets, however, owing to rebounds in the Southeast Asian markets.

The Bank has been informed that Sanyo Securities has decided to take legal measures to liquidate its affiliated entities, and that due to losses on credits extended to these affiliates, it has become difficult for Sanyo Securities to continue ordinary business.

On November 3, Sanyo Securities filed with the Tokyo District Court an application for the commencement of reorganization proceedings. In response to the application, the District Court has issued an asset preservation order halting the company's repayment activities, but has allowed for exceptions with regard to such activities as return of customer property. The Bank has been informed that customer property, including cash deposited by customers, will be protected and that the property will be returned swiftly with the support and cooperation of relevant parties, including the Securities Deposit Compensation Fund (a fund established for compensating customers' losses in the event of a failure of a member securities company) and the main banks of Sanyo Securities.

While the Bank regrets the failure of Sanyo Securities, the Bank acknowledges it crucial that investors be protected and the stability of the securities market be secured through the efforts of relevant parties in order to maintain confidence in the Japanese financial system at home and abroad.

If I may now turn to developments in lending by financial institutions, there have recently been views that financial institutions may have become too cautious with their lending, and this as a result may be constraining the economic activity of private businesses. I would like to briefly discuss the Bank's present views on this point.

It is true that an increasing number of financial institutions are strengthening risk management and attaching more importance to profitability in order to improve the soundness and efficiency of their management and operations. More specifically, they are revising their screening systems to assess more rigorously the creditworthiness of borrowers. They are also establishing lending rate structures that adequately reflect creditworthiness. These efforts are essential to financial institutions if they are to accommodate themselves to the ongoing financial globalization and deregulation over the long run. However, it may appear to firms that financial institutions have significantly shifted their lending attitude, or have suddenly adopted a very strict lending policy.

Having said that, financial institutions maintain a positive lending stance toward firms showing sound business performance. In fact, the Tankan survey indicates that while an increasing number of firms in certain sectors feel that the lending attitude has become ""severe,"" more firms feel that the attitude remains ""accommodative."" The average lending rates of financial institutions have been linked to market rates at historically low levels.

In view of these circumstances, it is fair to assume that the recent slow growth in lending by financial institutions is due to weak demand for funds arising against the background of decelerating domestic demand. Therefore, the Bank considers that the lending attitude of financial institutions is, at the moment, not constraining business activity, nor militating against the economy.

The Bank will continue to monitor carefully the lending activity of financial institutions focusing on (1) whether the stance of financial institutions is reaching a point where even firms maintaining sound management find it difficult to borrow; and (2) whether squeezed lending is leading to a general rise in interest rates.

C. Monetary Policy Management
After the effects of the rise in the consumption tax rate are excluded, prices can be seen to have remained generally stable and are expected to remains so for some time.

In managing monetary policy under such a monetary and economic situation, the Bank believes it appropriate to continue to watch developments carefully with an emphasis being placed on further strengthening the foundation of the economic recovery.

III. Bank's Thinking Behind Its Continued Easy Stance of Monetary Policy
A. The Effects of Monetary Easing
I would like to use the remaining time to discuss the Bank's views on some of the comments and questions the Bank has been receiving in relation to the prolonged low level of interest rates.

First, there have been questions about the effects of monetary easing -- that is, although low interest rates are conducive to improving corporate profits, it seems that businesses are simply using those earnings to repay their debts, and therefore, the desired effects of stimulating economic activity, such as increasing investment, have not been achieved. Some even say that the low interest rates are only delaying the structural adjustment of the Japanese economy.

If we take a look at the actual figures of corporate profits and business fixed investment, cash flow of firms -- that is, retained earnings plus depreciation -- increased by approximately 7 trillion yen in the two years since fiscal 1995, when the official discount rate was lowered to 0.5 percent. Business fixed investment also increased by approximately 7 trillion yen, commensurate with the growth in corporate profits. During this two-year period, the low interest rates have helped to improve the profitability of investment and to support corporate profits. Therefore, the Bank believes that low interest rates have had the effect of generating an appropriate increase in business fixed investment.

It should be noted, however, that in past phases of economic recovery, firms borrowed from financial institutions to expand their business fixed investment in addition to using their cash flow. This time, however, few firms have increased bank lending or issued bonds for this purpose. Rather, in quite a few cases, firms have used the increase in profits to repay their debt.

Thus, there has been no significant acceleration of business fixed investment when compared to past recovery phases. One factor behind this seems to be the various structural adjustment pressures that the Japanese economy faces today, notably persistent balance-sheet adjustment pressures.

As you are aware, many firms borrowed actively from financial institutions during the economic ""bubble"" period to engage in large-scale real-estate investment or securities investment. Following the bursting of the economic ""bubble,"" prices of real estate and stocks plunged. The borrowings, however, remained. Thus, on corporate balance sheets, there was a significant depreciation of assets at market value while liabilities remained unchanged. This resulted in a decrease in the net worth of firms -- that is, assets less liabilities -- and this in turn has limited the business risks that these firms can take on. Firms in this situation can rarely conduct active investment in plant and equipment that leads to the expansion of their business activity. This situation is often referred to as the ""balance-sheet problem.""

When we look at the relationship between balance sheets and business fixed investment by sector and by the size of firm, large manufacturers are faced with only limited balance-sheet adjustment pressures since they did not take on large debts during the ""bubble"" period. These large manufacturing firms saw an early recovery in profits following the collapse of the economic ""bubble,"" and in fact, have been investing significant amounts in plant and equipment since fiscal 1995.

Smaller firms, however, especially those in the nonmanufacturing sector, continue to suffer heavy balance-sheet adjustment pressures, having borrowed heavily from financial institutions during the ""bubble"" period to invest in real estate. The ratio of financial liabilities to assets at market value of smaller nonmanufacturing firms remains at a high level. As these firms have been most strongly affected by industrial restructuring, their profits as a whole have been slow to recover. As a result, their business fixed investment has shown little signs of improvement.

Yet, it cannot be said that low interest rates have proved ineffective to alleviate firms' balance-sheet problems. The only ways to alleviate the balance-sheet adjustment pressures is for firms to increase profits, and low interest rates have contributed broadly to improving firms' profits. With increased profits, firms can repay borrowings and thereby recover their net worth. Also, a forecasted rise in a firm's profits would facilitate the raising of capital by that firm. Thus, increasing profits is most effective in improving the financial strength of a firm, and the repayment of debt is an important process in allowing a firm to prepare for future business activity.

Although in the current phase of economic recovery, low interest rates have not yet triggered any significant rise in business fixed investment in the smaller nonmanufacturing firms, these rates have steadily contributed to establishing the foundation of the recovery by helping to improve firms' financial strength. Including such indirect effects, the Bank believes that the low interest rates have in fact been firmly supporting the recovery of economic activity in the corporate sector.

I would now like to go on to another often raised question about whether low interest rates are delaying the structural adjustment. It is true that there may be firms that are managing to survive despite a deteriorating business performance, owing to lower interest rates alleviating the burden of paying interest. My view, however, is that structural adjustment of the economy is achieved not just through natural selection of firms, where those with extremely poor business performance are weeded out. Rather, I believe that it is achieved when the large number of firms with high growth potentials enhance their activities. Therefore, in order to promote structural adjustment, it is most important to pursue effective deregulation.

Monetary policy, by nature, is not aimed at promoting structural adjustment. It is to be managed in accordance with economic and price developments with the aim of achieving noninflationary, sustainable growth. However, monetary policy can realize a stable macroeconomic environment, that in turn would facilitate structural adjustment. This is because firms can confidently undergo forward-looking business transformation only when there is a stable macroeconomic environment. Also, as I have already stated, monetary easing has been contributing to the balance-sheet adjustment of firms.

The Bank believes that if interest rates were to be raised before economic activity has sufficiently firmed, it may affect not only troubled firms but also growing businesses. In view of the fundamentally weak earnings structure of venture businesses, which are expected to be the driving force of the structural reform, it can easily be imagined that an untimely raising of interest rates would make the progress of industrial restructuring even more difficult.

In other words, although monetary easing is not directly aimed at promoting structural adjustment, by providing a stable macroeconomic environment, it does support the management efforts of many firms with high growth potentials and thereby contributes to laying the foundation for structural adjustment. I very much hope to gain your understanding on the importance of this point.

B. Monetary Easing and Income Distribution
Another set of comments and questions that the Bank often receives in relation to the low level of interest rates concerns the issue of income distribution. There have been comments that low interest rates are sacrificing the household sector, or that they are aimed solely at supporting the profits of financial institutions. As I have spoken on this subject on various occasions already, I will give only a brief explanation of the Bank's views.

Monetary easing would have the impact of reducing interest earning on deposits and bonds while lowering interest payments on mortgage loans and other liabilities. As the household sector holds a larger amount of financial assets than financial liabilities, lower interest rates would in fact to reduce the net interest income. It would not be appropriate, however, to judge the effects of monetary easing based simply on the interest income. Lower interest rates stimulate economic activity by improving returns on investment, increasing corporate profits, and supporting asset prices. This in turn leads to an increase in employment and in employees' income to thereby bring about a favorable impact on the household sector as a whole.

In fact, in the two years since fiscal 1995, when the series of monetary easing measures was implemented, employees' income has increased steadily, and this increase has significantly exceeded the net decrease in interest income. This implies that the monetary easing, by stimulating economic activity, has had favorable effects on the entire household sector.

In reality, there are various types of households, and the Bank is fully aware that the situation has been extremely difficult for those households that are heavily dependent on interest income. However, I would like to emphasize that monetary policy should be managed from a macroeconomic perspective for the purpose of achieving a self-sustained economic recovery. When a self-sustained recovery is realized, benefits will accrue broadly to all sectors, including the household sector.

In relation to the profits of financial institutions, monetary easing was not implemented for the purpose of increasing financial institutions' earnings and the Bank has absolutely no intention of managing monetary policy to aid financial institutions.

The misunderstanding over the Bank's intentions seems to derive from the fact that operating profits of financial institutions tend to increase when interest rates decline. For example, in fiscal 1995, when there was a sharp decline in interest rates, operating profits of financial institutions rose significantly. This is partly due to the fact that when interest rates decline, the prices of their bond-holdings rise, and therefore, their profits on sales tend to increase. It is also due to the fact that lower interest rates are reflected immediately on the liability side, whereas their effects appear more slowly on the asset side, since the average length of maturity of assets, such as loans, tends to be longer than the average length of maturity of liabilities such as deposits.

However, these effects are only temporary. For example, once the effects of lower interest rates have worked their way through, sale of bonds will no longer generate new profits. Moreover, if interest rates begin to rise, the sale of bonds will start creating losses. In addition, maturity gap between assets and liabilities will cause profits to decline from the following accounting term reflecting declines in the returns on interest-earning assets, which follow the fall in the cost of financing liabilities. In fact, the operating profits of financial institutions, after rising significantly in fiscal 1995, leveled off in fiscal 1996. In fiscal 1997, they are likely to register a substantial decline as the effects of reduced interest rates will have diminished.

In the meantime, the net interest margin of financial institutions -- that is, the differential between financing costs and investment returns -- remains at a level equal to the average since the latter half of the 1980s. In other words, the decline in deposit interest rates has not permanently widened the interest margin for financial institutions, which is only the intermediate stage in the permeation of monetary-easing effects. Rather, the decline has subsequently lead to lower lending rates. Through these channels, the effects of monetary easing have been permeating steadily through the entire Japanese economy.

As I have explained, monetary policy is not aimed at supporting financial institutions, and it is not possible to control the earnings of financial institutions by means of monetary policy over an extended period. I would once again like to emphasize that monetary policy is to be managed in accordance with the overall economic condition for the purpose of ensuring price stability.

C. Monetary Policy Management from a Medium- to Long-Term Perspective
I would like to turn to a third set of comments and questions received by the Bank related to its monetary policy management. It is a question of whether the official discount rate should have been raised sometime between 1996 and early 1997, when the economy was recovering.

Monetary policy should, by its very nature, be monitored over a long period of time. In addition, I believe it is not appropriate for the Bank, which is in charge of monetary policy management, to give its own assessment casually. Today, therefore, I would like to explain the basic thinking underlying the Bank's monetary policy management, including that on the recent interest-rate policy.

The drastic monetary easing measures the Bank implemented in September 1995 -- including the lowering of the official discount rate to 0.5 percent -- was aimed at preventing the occurrence of a deflationary spiral and was intended to place the Japanese economy on a path of self-sustained recovery by strengthening corporate and household confidence in the economy. Since the beginning of 1996, the Japanese economy has recovered moderately. In the course of the recovery, the concern for a possible deflationary spiral has been gradually dispelled, and the confidence of the corporate and household sectors has been gradually regained. Looking back, it appears that the recovery in early 1996 was supported significantly by the series of monetary easing measures and government economic packages adopted in autumn 1995. It also cannot be denied that the growth rate from the second half of 1996 through spring 1997 was boosted by a significant step-up in demand ahead of the rise in the consumption tax rate. Under these circumstances, it was too soon to conclude that the private sector had gained sufficient strength to achieve a self-sustained recovery on its own while dealing with the impact of fiscal tightening. If the monetary support were to have been discontinued before the economy had gained adequate strength, it would have become more difficult to attain a self-sustained recovery. This is precisely why the Bank has maintained its easy stance of monetary policy since September 1995.

In connection with the Bank's current stance of monetary policy management, I would like to mention another important point. The Bank aims to achieve price stability and thereby noninflationary, sustainable economic growth over a medium to long term. Accordingly, it is necessary to predict economic developments and to take fully into consideration the time required for monetary policy effects to spread throughout the economy when managing monetary policy. Were we to implement monetary policy merely to respond to the immediate economic condition, it may only amplify economic fluctuations.

For example, when the Bank takes monetary policy measures in response to immediate improvements in economic activity, this action could carry two conceivable risks. The first is the risk that at the time the economic upturn is confirmed, prices may already have started to rise. Considering the time necessary for monetary policy effects to permeate throughout the economy, the central bank must act more preemptively, as it is too late to take action after price rises have been confirmed. The other is the risk that the strength of recovery is insufficient although economic activity may have started to improve. Monetary tightening under such circumstances may impair the force of recovery that had at last started to grow. In other words, monetary tightening at this time will be premature.

Thus, it is extremely important that monetary policy be managed from a medium - to long-term perspective. With this in mind, the Bank, in its management of monetary policy, has emphasized accurate prediction of economic and price developments rather than the economic condition at the time. Further, in accurately predicting these developments, the Bank has focused on the strength of the self-sustained recovery in the private sector.

This does not mean, however, that the Bank is not carefully monitoring the potential risks arising from the prolonged easing of monetary policy. It is particularly important for the Bank to constantly verify that the low interest rates are not expanding the potential risk of inflation. In the past, there were times when the effects of monetary easing amplified rapidly, increasing abruptly the risk of inflation. In view of the time needed for monetary policy effects to permeate, the task of assessing potential risk cannot be neglected.

As I stated earlier, the Bank judges that there is no large risk of inflation at the moment. We at the Bank continue to seek appropriate policy decisions from a medium- to long-term perspective by accurately identifying the risk of price movements.

IV. Conclusion
I very much hope that my discussion today has helped you understand the keypoints in the Bank's monetary policy management. The Bank will continue to make the utmost effort to manage monetary policy properly to achieve price stability.

If I may add to what I have said with regard to the monetary and economic conditions in Japan, the Bank believes it is important to strengthen corporate and household confidence in the economy in order to gain a clearer outlook for economic recovery. The recent cautious business sentiment seems to reflect the concerns held by firms over the ongoing structural adjustment, the completion of which is taking longer than expected. This being the case, I believe the important challenge for the Japanese economy continues to be the implementation of structural measures including deregulation and liquidation of real estate.

I appreciate your kind attention.",,Neutral,0.9156169891,,
"Dec. 12, 1997","Speech given by Yasuo Matsushita, Governor of the Bank of Japan, to the Japan National Press Club in Tokyo on December 12, 1997 (Recent Financial and Economic Conditions in Japan)","I truly appreciate this opportunity to address this distinguished audience at the Japan National Press Club.

The circumstances of the Japanese economy and financial system have increased in severity in the past six months. The economy has not shown any definite signs of recovery since its reaction to the rise in the consumption tax rate in April 1997. Rather, economic recovery appears to be decelerating. The currencies and financial markets of Southeast Asian countries, which have been the high-growth area, have been in turmoil since summer of 1997, and adverse impact on the Japanese economy has been anticipated. In addition, recent successive failures of large Japanese financial institutions have once again aroused concern about the stability of Japan's financial system in Japan and abroad. Thus, it is not easy to judge where the Japanese economy is headed and to draw up a prescription for each problem.

In such a situation, it is important that the circumstances be analyzed carefully so as to perceive the underlying mechanism. This is because developments in the economy and the markets--even, or particularly, when they suggest confusion or disruption--often provide important indications or warnings that lead to a better solution of the problem.

Today, I would like to discuss and explain the Bank's thinking on three topics: issues concerning Japan's financial system, the turmoil in the Asian currencies and financial markets, and the domestic economic situation. These are three independent issues that are closely correlated in a way. I would like to explain them with a view to clarifying the underlying mechanism.

II. Issues Regarding Japan's Financial System
A. Resolution of Failed Financial Institutions
I would like to start with issues regarding Japan's financial system.

The successive failures of Japanese financial institutions since the fall of 1997 have once again emphasized domestically and internationally the severity of the situation facing the Japanese financial system, temporarily increasing the tension in the financial markets.

First, I would like to explain the measures the Bank has taken to deal with this situation and the thinking behind them.

When a financial institution fails, the most important task is to contain systemic risk. In other words, it is crucial to prevent the failure from affecting other financial institutions or the markets as a whole, disrupting the entire financial system, through widespread anxiety of depositors and market participants or through a chain reaction of defaults.

In order to contain systemic risk, two requirements must be satisfied. First, it must be ensured that smooth repayment of deposits be made by the failed financial institution. Second, it is important to avert liquidity contraction to ensure the stability of the entire financial system. Failure of financial institutions causes market participants to become overly cautious, making it difficult for transactions to come to terms. As a result, upward pressures tend to be placed on interest rates. Therefore, in order for these two requirements to be satisfied, the Bank took decisive measures in response to the financial institution failures.

To meet the first requirement, the Bank extended special loans as necessary to several failed institutions--for example, Hokkaido Takushoku Bank and Yamaichi Securities--under Article 25 of the Bank of Japan Law, without requiring the usual collateral.

The Bank has committed itself to providing funds for the purpose of ensuring the stability of the financial system only in cases where all of the following four conditions are met: (1) there is a strong possibility that systemic risk--a risk that failure of one financial institution to settle transactions with another may trigger a chain reaction of defaults--will materialize, and that as a result, confidence in other sound financial institutions will be undermined, or that runs on deposits will occur; (2) credit extension by the Bank is indispensable, as there are no other sources of funds; (3) measures are taken to prevent moral hazard; and (4) the financial soundness of the Bank will not be threatened.

In the cases of the recent financial institution failures, the Bank judged it appropriate to extend special loans after thoroughly examining these four points.

While the Bank had previously extended special loans to depository institutions, the loan extension to Yamaichi Securities should be regarded as an extraordinary measure. This is because the failure of a non-depository financial institution such as a securities company differs in several ways from the failure of a depository institution. Customers of a securities company conduct stock and bond transactions through the securities company, and are not in a creditor-debtor relationship with the company. They do deposit money and securities with a securities company, but unlike bank deposits, these are not means of payment. Accordingly, it is usually unlikely that the failure of a securities company would directly give rise to systemic risk.

Yamaichi Securities' decision to close down its business, however, is significant in that the company is one of Japan's four largest securities companies. Furthermore, considering the fact that the Japanese financial system is being viewed more critically and that Yamaichi conducted a wide range of business in domestic and overseas markets and had a large number of customers, any difficulties in returning customers' assets or in settling outstanding transactions in the process of closing down the company were quite likely to lead to withdrawal of customer assets from other securities companies or disrupt market transactions. If no measures had been taken to prevent such a situation, the credibility of the Japanese financial system could have been seriously eroded and disruptions could have been caused in domestic and overseas financial markets, in the end seriously affecting overall economic activity in Japan. Against this backdrop, the Bank decided to provide Yamaichi with necessary liquidity under Article 25 of the Bank of Japan Law in order to minimize the adverse impact of the closing down of the company's business on the domestic and overseas financial markets as well as the Japanese economy.

The Bank's measures had their intended effect: payment and settlement were executed smoothly by the failed institutions, and thus the materialization of systemic risk was avoided. However, the failures of large depository institutions and securities company made the behavior of market participants very cautious, and as a result, it became difficult for transactions to come to terms, placing upward pressures on market interest rates.

Therefore, to fulfill the second requirement in containing systemic risk, the Bank exerted itself to its utmost to avoid declines in market liquidity through market operations. The Bank utilized various market operations means to provide sufficient liquidity in the markets, to thereby support smooth market transactions and stable formation of market interest rates.

Since September 1995, the Bank has conducted market operations in order to maintain the uncollateralized overnight call money rate at a level on average slightly below the official discount rate. However, demand for funds in the market heightened following the series of financial institution failures, and at the end of November 1997, the call money rate rose far above this targeted level. The Bank therefore made continuous efforts to supply sufficient liquidity to the market, and as a result the rate has recently declined to the targeted level.

Rates on longer-term money market instruments, however, especially 1-month rates on end-of-year funds, remain high due to a rise in the ""Japan premium""--the extra funding cost that Japanese banks have to pay compared to leading U.S. and European banks due to a decline in their creditworthiness in international markets. The Bank would like to emphasize that it will continue to take a firm stance in its market operations toward the end of the year to ensure the stability of money market rates.

The Bank, in cooperation with the government, will continue to commit itself to maintaining the stability of the financial system, and strongly hopes that the public and market participants will act calmly.

B. The Implications of Recent Financial Institution Failures
Significant progress has been made toward the solution of the nonperforming-loan problem, and it can be said that the recent failures of financial institutions occurred amid this notable progress. Therefore, these failures can be considered to have important implications for the strengthening of Japan's financial system and for the restoring of domestic and international confidence in the system.

The disclosed amount of total nonperforming loans held by the Japanese depository institutions decreased from 38 trillion yen as of the end of March 1995 to 28 trillion yen as of the end of March 1997. Of this, the amount that needs to be disposed of, or those not covered by collateral or loan loss reserves, has been reduced from the 18 trillion yen in 1993 to 4.5 trillion yen. While this amount is still substantial, it is fair to say that there has been steady progress in the disposal of nonperforming loans.

A matter of concern is that the pace of disposal differs among financial institutions. For example, some financial institutions have completed removal of nonperforming loans from their balance sheets. Many other institutions seem to be planning to record net losses for the accounting term ending in March 1998 to dispose of a considerable amount of nonperforming loans. The overall progress in solving the nonperforming-loan problem, together with enhanced disclosure practices, has sharpened the contrast between institutions that are being prompt in dealing with their problem and those that lag behind.

Under such circumstances, there seem to be two requirements in restoring confidence in Japan's financial system at home and abroad.

First, it is necessary for financial institutions to further improve disclosure and thereby enhance the transparency of their management. Depositors, creditors, and other market participants are scrutinizing the financial conditions of Japanese financial institutions with increasing severity, and the scheduled introduction of Prompt Corrective Action in April 1998 and the implementation of the Japanese ""Big Bang"" deregulation measures are likely to encourage such tendency. Therefore, it is vital that individual financial institutions accelerate the disposal of nonperforming loans and the implementation of restructuring measures to ensure the market's confidence.

As for the disclosure of nonperforming loans held by financial institutions, a uniform standard has been established based on a recommendation by the Financial System Research Council to allow comparison between financial institutions, and the range of disclosure has been expanded in line with this standard. To increase the transparency of financial institution management and to thereby strengthen the market's confidence, however, it is essential that institutions expand the range of disclosure on their own initiative, not only with respect to nonperforming loans but also to the implementation of their restructuring measures, and thereby provide the market with a convincing explanation of how they intend to improve, or how they have improved, their financial strength.

Second, the recent series of financial institution failures has highlighted the importance of preventing the surfacing of systemic risk and of thereby ensuring the stability of the entire financial system. It must be remembered that in the financial system, an appropriate balance must be struck between the need to draw out the dynamism of the market mechanism and the need to ensure the stability of the system.

As I stated earlier, the financial strength of financial institutions is being more severely examined in anticipation of the implementation of the Japanese ""Big Bang."" To maintain the stability of the financial system under these circumstances, it is extremely important to ensure that even if the market were to pass a hard judgment on an institution, this would not shake the entire financial system.

In this regard, the provision of emergency liquidity for preventing any serious disturbance from occurring in the system, which I mentioned earlier, is the responsibility of the central bank as the ""lender of last resort.""

When the failed institution has a negative net worth, there is the problem of how to dispose of the ultimate losses. However, credit extension by the Bank is aimed solely at providing temporary liquidity, and not at making up for losses. Therefore, it is required that a loss-covering scheme be in place before swift repayment of deposits can be made and resolution of the failed institution be carried out smoothly.

The deposit insurance system is one of the frameworks made available for such schemes, and various measures have been taken to enhance the functions of the Deposit Insurance Corporation. There could be cases, however, where losses are too large for this system to bear. In such cases overseas, public funds have been used subject to certain conditions to solve the problem.

In view of those examples abroad and the current situation of Japan's financial system, an argument has been put forward that public funds should be utilized for the early and fundamental solution of the nonperforming loan problem, triggering serious debate in the Government and Diet. The Bank considers the argument to carry great significance for the domestic financial system, and therefore hopes that a national consensus on the matter will be reached through wide discussions.

The global and domestic conditions facing Japan's financial system are becoming increasingly harsh, as represented by the expansion of the ""Japan premium"" in international financial markets. Thus, Japan's financial system is at a critical juncture that will determine whether it can restore domestic and international confidence, with financial institutions further enhancing disclosure and accelerating the disposal of nonperforming loans, and the authorities ensuring the stability of the financial system.

III. Financial Conditions in Asia and Their Impact on the Japanese Economy
A. The Background of the Turmoil in Asian Financial Markets
Let me next discuss the recent developments in other Asian economies. In this section, I will refer to Asian economies on the basis of excluding that of Japan. To confront the turmoil in the Asian financial markets which started in summer 1997, various measures have been taken--each country has been adjusting its macroeconomic policy and setting out measures to stabilize the financial system, and international assistance has been provided under the leadership of the International Monetary Fund (IMF). However, instability remains in the financial and foreign exchange markets of these countries, and uncertainty prevails as to how their economies will evolve under the various economic measures. Today, therefore, I would like to examine the background of the Asian turmoil and its possible impact on the Japanese economy.

First, I would like to emphasize that it is not appropriate to perceive the currency turbulence in Asian countries as having been caused by speculative attacks by global investors on specific currencies and financial markets, and to emphasize the instability of international financial markets. Turmoil in the international financial and foreign exchange markets has occurred several times in the past: the demise of the postwar fixed exchange-rate system, established by the IMF in the 1970s; and the currency crises in the European Monetary System in 1992 and in Mexico in 1994.

In all the above cases, before the turbulence arose in the markets, there had been for some time a gap between the exchange rate of the country's currency and the real economic condition of the country, with that gap expanding gradually preceding the turbulence. Immediate adjustment of the foreign exchange rate is inevitable once market participants detect the situation. In the adjustment process, the exchange rate may overshoot, giving the impression that the market is in disruption. However, it is important that the grounds for such large fluctuations be clearly identified, or otherwise, the warning signals sent out by the market, which are pointing to the expanding gap in this case, will be overlooked.

With the emergence of the Asian currency turmoil, some have questioned the previous achievements of East Asian economies. This view also seems to be rather extreme. It appears that the potential growth rate of East Asia remains high, supported by its high-quality labor, high savings rate, and solid market and industry infrastructures. Although East Asian economies will face adjustment pressures in the short term, they can be expected to establish a foundation for further growth by carrying out various structural reforms based on their recent experiences.

What, then, can be considered to be the background of the recent turmoil in Asian currencies? While Asian countries differ from each other in many ways, one common factor is that most Asian currencies were pegged to the U.S. dollar, and under the peg, large amounts of foreign funds flowed in during the 1990s. This in turn led to excessive financial and investment activities, overheating of the economy, and accordingly, deterioration in the external balance.

It cannot be denied that there was a sense of euphoria, or an overexpectation of economic growth, in East Asia. When there is an influx of abundant funds based on such expectations, upward pressure is exerted on the foreign exchange rate of the country's currency. To maintain the pegged exchange rates, countries were under pressure to ease money to lower domestic interest rates or at least avoid monetary tightening. Such policy response fueled financial and investment activities, and this may have upheld the euphoria for a certain period of time.

Inflation rates in Asian countries rose due to overheated economic activity, and under their fixed exchange rate system, their currencies became overvalued. Consequently, the international competitiveness of these economies declined gradually and current account deficits expanded. The deficits in the current accounts were not a problem as long as they were financed by foreign capital. However, as soon as market participants began to doubt the sustainability of the external imbalance and the economic boom in the area, foreign funds were abruptly withdrawn from the countries, putting severe pressures on foreign exchange rates and stock prices. Against this backdrop, many countries were compelled to abandon their exchange rate pegs to the U.S. dollar and adopt a floating rate system.

Several important lessons can be drawn from this experience with regard to ensuring the stability of international financial markets. Obviously, preventing an overheating of economic and financial activities through proper macroeconomic policies is the most important prerequisite for securing the stability of one's own economy as well as the international financial markets. It is equally important to ensure flexible foreign exchange developments, promote information disclosure to allow the market mechanism to check the appropriateness of economic policies, and establish a sound financial system by, for example, reviewing the framework of financial institution supervision.

Based on these lessons, East Asian countries have embarked on the restoration of their economies and financial systems with international support. The Bank of Japan, too, continues to play an appropriate role in the framework in which the IMF takes the initiative. In terms of cooperation among Asian central banks, the Executives' Meeting of East Asia and Pacific Central Banks (EMEAP) was established in 1991. The governors' meeting has taken place annually since 1996; the first being held in Tokyo and the second in Shanghai. Taking the opportunity of such meetings, the Bank intends to strengthen its ties with other Asian central banks by exchanging views and extending technical assistance in various fields.

B. Impact on the Japanese Economy
Next, I would like to discuss the impact of developments in the Asian economies on that of Japan.

The economic relations between Japan and other Asian countries have been intensifying, and the region is now the largest trade partner of Japan. Of Japan's total exports, those to Asia's Newly Industrializing Economies (Asian NIEs) and the member countries of the Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN) account for about 35 percent, exceeding the share of exports to the United States and to the European Union, 30 percent and 15 percent respectively. As for Japan's imports, the share of imports from Asian NIEs and ASEAN countries has grown to almost 20 percent, approaching the 22 percent from the United States, which holds the largest share.

Accordingly, it is inevitable that the depreciation of the currencies and the economic slowdown due to the implementation of adjustment measures in these countries will affect the real economy of Japan. At present, demand in other regions such as China, the United States, and Europe is firm, and the average exchange rate of the yen (weighted by the value of trade with each country) remains stable. Thus, the export environment is not significantly deteriorating as a whole. However, exports to Asia, especially to Thailand and the Republic of Korea, have started decreasing.

Furthermore, slowdown of economic growth in East Asian countries is bringing about a fall in international commodities prices, especially those of raw materials. This is beginning to affect the profits of materials manufacturers in Japan, and as a result, some of these firms are planning to curtail production. Thus, careful observation of economic trends including these kinds of indirect impact is necessary.

In addition to developments in the real economy, the problem of nonperforming loans is surfacing in the Asian countries, although the degree differs from country to country.

According to statistics compiled by the Bank for International Settlements (BIS), the total credit exposure of Japanese banks to Asian countries amounts to US $270 billion, which accounts for about 30 percent of the total exposure of world's financial institutions to Asia.

However, these figures include Japanese banks' credits to Asian branches and affiliates of Japanese, U.S., and European financial institutions. Furthermore, a large portion of business credits of Japanese banks are extended to Japanese affiliates with a guarantee given by their parent companies. According to the Bank's survey, Japanese banks' credit exposure to non-Japanese firms and local banks in Asia appears to be around 30 to 40 percent of the total credit exposure reported in the BIS statistics. Moreover, most of such credit is loans to sound major banks and firms and project finances, which are unlikely to turn into nonperforming loans.

As discussed above, the impact of the currency and financial turmoil in Asia on the real economy and financial market of Japan has been limited to date. However, the economic situation in this region remains unstable. Therefore, the degree of economic slowdown and developments in the nonperforming-loan problem in these countries must continue to be monitored.

IV. Recent Financial and Economic Conditions and Monetary Policy Management in Japan
A. Domestic Financial and Economic Conditions
I would now like to move on to today's last topic--recent economic situation in Japan.

The decelerating trend of Japan's economic growth since April 1997 has been intensifying recently. In final demand, exports and business fixed investment continue to be on an upward trend, supporting economic activity. However, household spending such as personal consumption and housing investment, which fell substantially following the rise in the consumption tax rate in April 1997, is recovering only at a very slow pace. In personal consumption, outlays on services such as travel services have shown a moderate increase, while outlays on goods, as indicated by sales of automobiles and household electric appliances as well as department store sales, have remained sluggish. In addition, housing starts have declined more recently to 1.3 million from the 1.5 million per annum level prevailing until spring 1997.

With such weakness in final demand, inventory adjustment pressures remain in the consumer durables- and construction-related industries, and thus industrial production has been declining slightly. Such developments seem to be gradually affecting employment and income.

However, this year's temporary economic slowdown is inevitable in that the economy is at a phase in which the downward pressures of fiscal tightening appear most strongly. The concern is how these developments will affect the momentum of the self-sustained economic recovery in 1998. At present, corporate profits and employment income, which form the basis of the self-sustained recovery, continue to be on an upward trend. Therefore, it is unlikely that the economy has entered a recession. However, there is some weakening of the virtuous circle of production, income, and expenditure, and if this trend continues, it may undermine the strength of the self-sustained recovery. The Bank will therefore continue closely to monitor the pace of recovery in consumption, progress in inventory adjustment, and developments in household and corporate sentiment.

Meanwhile, prices have remained stable on the whole. Domestic wholesale prices have continued to decline slowly, particularly those of construction materials. Consumer prices, after excluding the effect of the rise in the consumption tax rate, have been at a level slightly above that of the previous year, and corporate service prices remain at the previous year's level.

In view of such economic and price conditions, the Bank is determined to observe developments carefully in managing monetary policy, placing emphasis on strengthening the foundation of the economic recovery. In the conduct of market operations, the Bank intends to continue supplying sufficient liquidity to the financial market, to thereby ensure smooth transactions and stability of market interest rates.

B. Lending Attitude of Financial Institutions
With regard to the recent financial situation, there have been various discussions concerning the cautious lending attitude of financial institutions.

Today, financial institutions are faced with many challenging management issues, such as expeditious disposal of nonperforming loans, as well as implementation of measures to deal with the Japanese ""Big Bang"" financial reform and with the introduction of Prompt Corrective Action. Therefore, with a view to enhancing the soundness and efficiency of management, an increasing number of financial institutions are strengthening their risk management and attaching more importance to profitability in their extension of loans. These efforts by financial institutions are indispensable for strengthening Japan's financial system. However, it is a matter of concern whether the cautious lending attitude of financial institutions has reached the point where it hinders the recovery of the economy as a whole.

To date, partly because of weak corporate demand for funds, there has been neither any significant shortage of funds in corporate financing nor an overall rise in lending rates due to a squeeze in lending. Therefore, the Bank believes that the cautious lending attitude of financial institutions is not hampering economic recovery at present. However, risk management systems of financial institutions are being further reinforced. In addition, the influence of developments in financial markets, such as low stock prices and the rise in the ""Japan premium,"" on financial institutions' lending activity requires due attention.

While the current lending activity of financial institutions is not hampering economic recovery, it is not positively contributing to the recovery as it did during past periods of monetary easing. This fact offers a significant point for discussion when considering the interaction between financial activity and real economic activity, because the expected role of financial institutions goes beyond merely responding passively to corporate demand for funds.

Financial institutions are expected to actively support forward-looking business activities--for example, by helping corporations find new business opportunities and accepting financial risks when new businesses are started. In fact, such functions of financial institutions played a significant role in promoting economic recovery in the past. While it is true that financial institutions went too far in these activities, leading to the emergence of the economic ""bubble,"" it is also undeniable that in the present phase of economic recovery financial support for economic activity has been weak. In order to ensure economic recovery, it is important to strengthen the functions of financial institutions and the financial market, thereby restoring a strong and efficient financial system. I would like to point out that the cautious lending attitude of financial institutions, causing the so-called ""credit crunch,"" should therefore be discussed in connection with the issue of strengthening the financial system.

C. The Significance of Stronger Confidence in the Economy
The Bank's primary concern regarding the economy is the fact that the confidence of firms and households in the Japanese economy and its outlook seems to be deteriorating.

It is very difficult to measure accurately the level of confidence of economic entities. However, the financial and asset markets offer some important information. Asset values, for example, reflect the expectations of market participants as to the future profits which may be earned by holding such assets.

How, then, should we see the recent low level of stock prices? Corporate profits are at a significantly higher level today compared with those in 1995, when there were concerns about a deflationary spiral. However, stock prices are close to the 1995 level. This suggests that confidence in the economy has weakened compared with that in 1995. Under such circumstances, firms and financial institutions would be inclined to hold back from forward-looking activities that involve risks. Weakened confidence would also reduce the effects of monetary easing.

However, it seems unnatural to assume that the potential growth rate of the Japanese economy in the medium to long term has declined significantly in the past two years. In 1995, for example, there were strong concerns over the future of Japanese industry, due to increasing competition with other Asian economies and anxiety over a hollowing-out of industry, but Japanese firms are responding by building new global networks of production and parts procurement, utilizing the new international division of labor. Also, with the depreciation of the yen, apprehension about the international competitiveness of Japanese industry seems to have receded considerably.

In view of these conditions, the weakening confidence in the economy that is reflected in the low stock prices must be attributable to some other factor. A clue in finding the answer is the fact that the ""outlook for the economy"" does not reflect only the estimated potential growth rate, but also uncertainty regarding its realization.

For example, even when similar levels of profit growth are expected, stock prices will decline when there is greater uncertainty about the realization of the expected profit growth, in other words, when the risk premium expands. The same phenomenon can be observed in the economy as a whole. Uncertainty regarding future developments significantly undermines confidence in the economy.

Thus, it can be said that the present weakness of confidence in the economy is related to the fact that the Japanese economy is at a critical phase of various structural reforms, including financial system reforms. There are many uncertainties surrounding economic entities--such as the developments in the financial system, the progress of structural reform of the economy such as deregulation, and issues regarding public pensions, which have substantial impact on household income. Therefore, the important issue now is to clarify the outlook for each of these factors, including the prospect of additional burdens and costs.

I mentioned earlier that confidence in the economic outlook is based on two factors, namely, expected growth and risk premiums. It is quite difficult to boost the potential growth rate or expectation of growth through economic policy in the short term. However, it is possible to reduce uncertainty about the economy, and this is an effective and credible method of reinforcing confidence in a market economy. In this regard, making steady progress in structural reforms such as deregulation and ensuring the stability of the financial system are significant. If these efforts can reduce uncertainty about economic and financial developments, then the present monetary easing will be more effective in stimulating economic activity, strengthening the force of the virtuous circle in the economy.

"Jun. 29, 1998","Speech by Susumu Taketomi, Member of the Policy Board, at an Economic Seminar on the Japanese Economy in Bangkok on June 29, 1998 (The Current Economic Situation in Japan and its Future)","Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen.

I am delighted to be here today to share with you some thoughts on what is really taking place in the Japanese economy.

Speakers are normally expected to come up with a joke or two at the beginning of their speeches. I feel inclined not to do so in view of the agonizing economic conditions here in Thailand and back in Japan. May I save a joke until our economy and your economy get better?

Let me start out my speech by suggesting that the Japanese economy stands at a historical turning point both from a domestic and an international perspectives.

You may have heard the expression ""systemic fatigue"" from some of the opinion leaders in Japan. We also often use the word ""1940 regime"" referring to the economic system we have used over the past half century.

Faced with a prolonged recession throughout the 1990's, many people in Japan have come to realize that the post-world war II system, which was once so instrumental in achieving a high economic growth, may no longer be so effective going into the 21st century when the four mega-trends already in place will further intensify: namely, (1) acceleration of economic maturation, (2) further aging of the population, (3) acceleration of globalization and (4) advancement of information-based economy.

From the standpoint of a domestic time horizon we have clearly reached a stage in history where we must shift from our traditional system into a regulation-free, market-oriented and open economic regime if, in the future, we are to maintain or improve our standard of living in terms of real disposable income per capita.

On the international dimension, in the post cold war environment, the Japanese economy has been exposed to the pressure of having to adopt ""internationally-accepted standards"" in order to survive much fiercer world-wide mega-competition, with the US economy revitalizing itself and newly emerging countries entering world markets.

Just when these pressures, domestic and international, were mounting to force drastic changes in the basic framework of the Japanese economy, the ""bubble economy"" burst, intensifying and prolonging the subsequent process of structural adjustment. Continuous appreciation of the Yen through the mid-1990's dealt an additional blow to the economy. In my view, the kind of structural adjustment our economy has been struggling with since the beginning of the 1990's would normally take over a decade before being consummated. Any system, however beautiful and successful, cannot escape eventually becoming obsolete and outdated. It is no exaggeration to say that this is a paradigm conversion and seismic plate shift for our economy.

Putting aside this long-term assessment and focusing on the short-term Japanese economy, it can be said that we are in the middle of a second cyclical downturn in the structurally-stricken 1990's.

It is recently announced that the Japanese economy started receding in March, 1997. Most likely, this was due initially to the expected accentuation of the fiscal drag, especially the often-quoted three-stage outflows of income from the household sector to the government, which took place from April through October,1997, in the form of a consumption tax hike, discontinuation of a special tax cut and a reduction in medical expense subsidies. It is said that these burdens add up to nine trillion yen.

This income transfer played a key role in reducing demand, particularly consumer spending. The decline in final demand was much deeper than suppliers had originally anticipated. Production had to be sharply cut back to bring inventory down to an appropriate level, but this move was unsuccessful. As a consequence, corporate profits sharply deteriorated in the second half of fiscal year 1997, thereby further curtailing capital investment. Adjustments in the corporate sector had to be extended to reducing overinflated work force, leading to the unprecedented high unemployment rate.

In addition to coping with the adverse impact from this reversal of income distribution, however, the Japanese economy, in the late autumn of 1997, came to be forced to adjust itself even further. The collapse of large-scale financial institutions triggered a deterioration of confidence held by bankers, industrialists, savers and consumers alike. Sharper consciousness of credit risks, concern over a credit crunch and apprehension over the safety of deposits prevailed. This gave rise to the mutually-reinforcing process of aggravated financial conditions, on one hand, and the slide of the real economy, on the other. In addition, it became increasingly evident that the swing in confidence amplified the downturn in business conditions.

It appears that, beneath this sudden and abrupt change in the tempo of cyclical decline, our economy has an inherent vulnerability and weakness which tends to force economic entities to nervously react to the outbreak of various shocks, such as a major bank failure or a sharp turnaround in the performance of the Asian economies. This vulnerability is the end result of the prolonged structural adjustments which our economy has been making since the bubble economy burst.

There are many current issues which our economy is facing. Due to time constraints, I will only discuss three key issues here. The first is the question of whether we are really on the brink of a deflationary spiral. The second addresses the role confidence plays in the economy. The third regards the linkage between the restoration of the financial system's stability and the recovery of the real economy. I am fully aware of other issues such as an increase in unemployment and currency fluctuations, but these problems are closely tied to the issue of how we will help the economy recover, which I do intend to cover.

Let me start with the first question. Many people seem to be concerned that the aggravated environment of income and employment may reignite a second round of cyclical decline with the reduced consumption leading the way. They are apprehensive because they feel that the gap between supply and demand may widen as domestic demand erodes, thus pushing prices down a little further and more extensively.

May I humbly submit to you, however, that by virtue of Japan's large-scale stimulus package there is at least a chance that our economy can avoid a deflationary spiral. The effect of the pump-priming effort will naturally depend on how expeditiously the package can be implemented. In anticipation of the pace of implementation accelerating this late autumn, most business executives will continue to carry out their current destocking of inventory for a few more months, in order to more effectively capitalize on the demand created by the government. This will mean, however, that economic indicators released between now and autumn may not necessarily point to improvement in business activity. It is therefore crucial whether or not business sentiment, consumer confidence and market psychology can endure growing skepticism during the interim. In this connection, I am somewhat relieved by the result of the Bank of Japan's Tankan survey which was released just this morning. As you may know, the Tankan is a quarterly survey on economic conditions. The diffusion index of the current survey has worsened from the previous one. This, however, was expected. What is important is the outlook for three months ahead: business sentiment in September is expected to be less severe.

In looking at the substance of the package, I can perhaps say that the current measures are better placed than those in the first half of the 1990's. To begin with, there is much less dependence on Investment and Trust Accounts. Aside from the conventional public works which the government hopes will have an immediate effect on creating demand, there are measures addressing enhancement of structural reform and promoting resolution of bad debt problems, including securitization of non-performing properties.

Regarding the phase of the business cycle, there may be less risk now than there was in the first half of the 1990's for the package's effect to be offset by overwhelming downward pressures on demand. Capital stock adjustment seems less severe now than then, when private sector fixed investment had to be reduced for three consecutive years. There was also pressure from the yen's appreciation at that time. Production facilities had to be relocated overseas in an attempt to pursue a horizontal division of labor with Asia. Today, however, we face different environmental hazards, such as the surfacing of an asset deflation problem in the form of collapses of major financial institutions and the severe recession in Asia. At the very least, it can be said that the negative forces at work today are different from those in the early 1990's.

A discussion of deflationary trends is incomplete without any mention of the current decline in prices.

There are three dimensions to the present fall in prices. First, prices have been plummeting throughout the 1990's, probably reflecting a rectification process of our former price structure. The relationship between prices of goods and those of services and assets was hardly rational. If the general price level has been dropping in search of a new equilibrium as a key to rationalizing the conventional price structure, then this is somewhat encouraging because it implies a narrowing of the productivity and profitability gap between different sectors.

Second, stagnation in prices for primary products is currently spreading through our economy. At this stage, this is a positive phenomenon because it means improvements in the terms of trade.

Third, decline in prices stemming from the widening gap between supply and demand in the domestic market has the potential to be particularly rough if a second round of demand shrinkage were to take place. However, as I indicated earlier, we will probably be able to preempt this risk with the help of the demand creation effect the stimulus package is supposed to have.

Now let me turn to the second issue of whether or not restoring confidence will lead to some recovery in private sector demand.

While those in the market admit that the stimulus package will halt the slide in demand, they are still skeptical about the spill-over effect as the expected rate of GDP growth is much lower now than in the past. Apparent market sentiment is that, despite a continued low interest rate policy and a large injection of public sector demand, private sector investment will show very little, if any, sign of moving forward in the absence of new production frontiers. Moreover, there seems to be a sense of uncertainty with regard to how various efforts for structural reform will converge and how economic reinvigoration can be achieved without fundamental changes in the tax structure.

Hopefully, however, this subdued market sentiment will change for the better if and when markets detect early signs of increasing order flow from the government and fundamental changes in the policy stance with regard to the tax reform and the resolution of the bad loan problems.

Over the past year or so, the household sector has not been free from a confidence crisis, either, as the sharp drop in propensity to consume so eloquently demonstrates.

According to a survey by the Bank of Japan, consumers have restrained spending due primarily to anxiety about job security and future income stream. Frequent major bankruptcies and the fragile financial system may have played a role in this erosion of confidence.

It is important to add that an expected increase in the burden resulting from reforms in the tax and medical insurance systems, together with concerns over future pension and social insurance receipts, has contributed to spending cuts by young people in their twenties and thirties.

It is only fair to point out, however, that the recent decline in consumption is not solely attributable to the deterioration of confidence.

There has been an inconsequential change in the structure of consumption. The share of optional personal expenditures out of total household spending has increased from about 17% in pre-bubble 1984 to nearly 26% in 1997. Optional consumption is the purchases of consumer durable goods and expenditures on non-essential services such as leisure.

As any economy matures and becomes affluent, optional spending tends to increase in share. As a result, the trend of total economy is likely to be determined by the consumption cycle. In this sense I like to interpret the recent downward swing in the propensity to consume as evidence that Japanese consumers have some room to maneuver during times of adversity.

My review of the confidence issue has led me to the policy implication that top priority must be placed on measures which specifically aim at removing the sources of apprehension.

This in part ties into the third issue which requires most urgent and careful attention; that is, it is difficult for economic recovery to materialize without restoring public trust in the soundness of the financial system.

Back in February of this year, the framework of injecting up to 30 trillion yen of public funds was established to stabilize the financial system. 17 trillion yen is meant to unconditionally protect depositors until March, 2001 when the so-called Big Bang is to be completed, while the remaining 13 trillion yen is supposed to be mobilized in recapitalizing the banking industry.

As the first step, subordinated loans/notes and/or preferred stocks of 1.8 trillion yen was injected in major banks, predicated on the submission of restructuring plans from individual banks. Disclosures of bad loans in accordance with SEC criteria were also made.

Yet bank stocks have dropped, the yen has depreciated and JGB yields have been reduced. In recognition of this serious situation, the government and the ruling coalition parties have embarked upon conceptualizing an ""Overall Strategy for Revitalizing the Japanese Financial System."" However, the difficult question is how to sort out conflicting requirements: avoidance of moral hazard, maintenance of transparency and crisis management. Unfortunately, at this early stage, we cannot predict precisely how markets will respond to the final outcome of this overall strategy.

At any rate, the time for deliberation has ended and the time for action is upon us. It is imperative to end the vicious cycle between lingering concerns over the fragile banking system and worsening of the real economy.

As I have elaborated all along, the Japanese economy is at a watershed. I am hopeful, however, that we can somehow get through the imminent difficulties by taking bolder actions in accordance with the policy framework available to us today.

In this regard I would like to draw a parallel between the policy structure in Japan today and that in the US in the early 1990's.

In the US, supply-side policies like deregulation since the Carter administration and the tax system reform introduced by President Reagan, coupled with the development of information technology in the 1990's, paved the way for an industrial comeback. In addition, there was an accommodating macro-economic policy set-up of low interest rates as well as a weak dollar. It was against this background that the Resolution Trust Corporation was introduced to resolve, once and for all, the problems of the ailing financial industry.

There is no reason why we in Japan cannot overcome our economic and financial difficulties. The road ahead of us may be rough, but with a firm determination supported by a proper set of policy menus, problems can be resolved. We are fully aware that this is in the interest of not only ourselves, but also of our partners in Asia. With this remark I will conclude my speech and open up the floor for questions and answers. Thank you very much for your kind attention.",,Positive,0.6933369637,,
"Jul. 3, 1998","Speech by Susumu Taketomi, Member of the Policy Board, at the Forum on the Japanese Economy and the Regional Economic Crisis in Singapore on July 3, 1998 (The State of the Japanese Economy and Domestic Policy Responses)","Good morning, ladies and gentlemen.

As the first step, in March subordinated loans/notes and/or preferred stocks of 1.8 trillion yen was injected in major banks, predicated on the submission of restructuring plans from individual banks. Disclosures of bad loans in accordance with SEC criteria were also made.

Yet bank stocks dropped, the yen depreciated and JGB yields came down. In recognition of this serious situation, the government and the ruling party embarked upon formulating an ""Overall Strategy for Revitalizing the Japanese Financial System."" The finalization of the ""Bridge Bank"" scheme as of yesterday will hopefully expedite the process of financial consolidation.

At any rate, the time for deliberation has ended and the time for action is upon us. It is imperative to end the vicious cycle between lingering concerns over the fragile banking system and worsening of the real economy.

As I have elaborated all along, the Japanese economy is at a watershed. I am hopeful, however, that we can somehow get through the imminent difficulties by taking bolder actions in accordance with the policy framework available to us today.

There is no reason why we in Japan cannot overcome our economic and financial difficulties. The road ahead of us may be rough, but with a firm determination supported by a proper set of policy menus, problems can be resolved. We are fully aware that this is not only in the interest of ourselves, but also of our partners in Asia. With this remark I will conclude my speech. Thank you very much for your kind attention.",,Neutral,0.4972434342,,
"Jul. 29, 1998","Speech given by Masaru Hayami, Governor of the Bank of Japan, to the Yomiuri International Economic Society in Tokyo on July 29, 1998 (Issues Regarding the Japanese Financial System and Monetary Policy)","Introduction
It is a great pleasure to be invited to the Yomiuri International Economic Society and to have the opportunity to talk to you today. This is my first public address since I was appointed Governor of the Bank of Japan four months ago, and therefore I would like to speak broadly about the problems and challenges facing the Bank.

The Japanese economy has been going through a difficult period since the second half of 1997. The failure of financial institutions including the Hokkaido Takushoku Bank and Yamaichi Securities in November had a very unsettling psychological effect on depositors and investors. The confusion was calmed relatively quickly as the Bank of Japan provided ample funds in the markets and the government took various countermeasures. The markets, however, remain wary of the credit risks of financial institutions and also firms, as indicated by the nervous movements in stock prices and market interest rates. In this situation, financial institutions reinforced their cautious lending stance. Meanwhile, consumer sentiment deteriorated rapidly, and business fixed investment started to show a clear decline, particularly in small and medium-sized firms.

The current economic downturn began in the spring of 1997, triggered by such fiscal factors as the raising of the consumption tax rate and by the turmoil in various Asian currencies and economies. While this was how the downturn began, I believe that the disturbances in the financial system caused the declining trend to become firmly established.

This situation has made me more than ever conscious of the very close relation between economic conditions and the financial system. The most important challenge for the Japanese economy at this moment is to achieve simultaneously both the revitalization of the financial system and the recovery of the economy.

Keeping in mind this close connection between economic and financial matters, I would like to explain the Bank's views and thinking regarding current issues related to Japan's financial system and monetary policy.

II. Financial System Issues
A. The Nonperforming Assets Problem and the Japanese Economy
I would like to start with the issues related to Japan's financial system.

Looking back on developments in the Japanese economy, it is quite true that the economy experienced various shocks during fiscal 1997, each of considerable magnitude. However, I cannot help being struck by how vulnerable to these shocks the economy was when I take into account the fact that, prior to the downswing, the economy had exhibited very clear signs of a recovery. For instance, it had achieved real growth rates of 2.8 percent and 3.2 percent during fiscal 1995 and 1996, respectively. Moreover, during the 1996 calendar year, the Japanese economy had recorded a growth rate of 3.9 percent, the highest rate of all the G7 countries.

It seems to me that the deterioration in the economy since fiscal 1997 proved that the preceding recovery was merely driven by favorable circumstances, and confirmed that the self-sustaining power of the economy was still very weak. The recovery from the beginning of 1996 was supported by such favorable factors as (1) steady expansion of the world economy, including the Asian economies; (2) a downward trend in the value of the yen; and (3) a sharp increase in domestic demand for information technology-related equipment and systems. The Bank of Japan remained uncertain as to whether the recovery was self-sustaining, and was highly conscious of the downside risk that might materialize if these favorable conditions dissipated. For this reason, the Bank opted to maintain the extremely easy stance of monetary policy it had adopted since September 1995.

The fact that the economic recovery continued on the surface but was never accompanied by a strengthening of the private sector was attributable to the severe structural adjustment pressures burdening the Japanese economy. At the center of these was the balance-sheet adjustment pressure on firms and financial institutions.

During the years of Japan's economic ""bubble,"" some firms borrowed extensively from banks or issued an increased amount of bonds to finance massive real estate investments. With the collapse of the bubble, a plunge in real estate prices brought about a drastic depreciation of these firms' assets. On the other hand, bank loans and corporate bonds remained on their books at their original values, giving rise to a large gap between firms' assets and liabilities. Financial institutions experienced a similar imbalance as portions of their corporate lendings became nonperforming. This, which caused a major deterioration in the real capital base of firms and financial institutions, is the source of what is referred to as the balance-sheet adjustment pressure.

Firms and financial institutions plagued with the balance-sheet problem become more vulnerable to risks and find it difficult to venture into new business or extend new loans because of the contraction of their capital base. Under normal circumstances, a virtuous cycle can be expected in which firms enjoying rising profits will re-invest their earnings in new plant and equipment and the new investments in turn further boost profits. However, firms encumbered with balance-sheet problems will opt to use any additional profits to repay debts and write off nonperforming assets. Similarly, financial institutions cannot afford to take an active lending stance. As a result, it is difficult for self-sustained growth to ignite in an economy burdened with balance-sheet problems until the disposal of nonperforming assets has been completed.

Sound economic development requires a certain degree of risk-taking by the private sector. Sound risk-taking requires that the nonperforming-asset problem be solved and balance sheets be put back in good health.

It is particularly important to enhance the functions of the financial markets where such risk-taking activities are carried out. An essential function of the financial markets is to mediate between savings and investments and, during the process, to distribute the various risks inherent in the economy smoothly among investors, firms, and households. If the markets fail to fulfill this function properly, firms will not be able to raise the necessary funds and capital, and business opportunities will be wasted. Therefore, to induce the risk-taking activity essential for the economy to grow satisfactorily, it is necessary for Japan's financial markets to attain the capacity to offer a diverse range of financial products and services to investors and fund-raisers, which will lead to, among other things, expansion of the direct financing markets. Japan's financial Big Bang is designed to establish a competitive framework, which is indispensable for nurturing such markets. In order for market functions to be upgraded as intended by the Big Bang, first it is necessary to solve as soon as possible the nonperforming loan problem of financial institutions, which are the key market players.

B. Keys to the Prompt Solution of the Nonperforming-Asset Problem
Next I would like to move on to describe the progress made in the disposal of nonperforming loans by Japan's financial institutions.

Significant steps have been taken toward creating a full-fledged framework for the disposal of nonperforming loans, such as the announcement of the Comprehensive Plan for Financial Revitalization, the so-called Total Plan, in early July by the government and the ruling Liberal Democratic Party. I ardently hope that the new administration will take form very soon and that it will waste no time in showing leadership in revitalizing the financial system by implementing the measures contained in the Total Plan. Then the next challenge will be to make maximum use of the framework to achieve speedy disposal of nonperforming loans. I believe there are three keys to successfully carrying out this process.

The first is full disclosure of nonperforming loans, a very important prerequisite for forwarding the disposal.

It is quite true that, over the past few years, disclosure of the nonperforming loans of financial institutions has been expanded. For instance, the new disclosure standards applied from the fiscal year ended March 1998 are comparable to the United States' SEC standards. Unfortunately, however, skepticism persists in both the domestic and overseas markets that there are still substantial amounts of loans not subject to disclosure but may in fact be bad loans. Regarding this point, the data released by the Financial Supervisory Agency on July 17 showed a total of approximately 29.8 trillion yen in ""risk management loans"" for all Japanese banks as of March 1998.1 It should be pointed out, however, that according to the self-assessment of assets made by financial institutions for the purpose of appropriate write-offs and provisioning, all Japanese banks have a total of 6.1 trillion yen in Category III, exposures where banks have serious concerns about ultimate collection, and 65.8 trillion yen in Category II, exposures requiring risk management on a one by one basis. There is no doubt that Category II contains a number of credit exposures on which, if they are properly managed, the banks will not incur losses. Hence, it is not appropriate to regard all these assets as nonperforming. For instance, Category II includes loans to firms whose credit risks have come to require special attention because of business cycle factors. In many cases, these loans start generating profits for financial institutions once the economy enters a recovery phase and corporate performance improves.

In any case, however, the ambiguity that remains about the massive amount of self-assessed credit exposures is apparently exacerbating the anxiety of the markets. It is a crucial deficiency for financial institutions, whose very existence is based on credibility and trust, not to be able to gain the confidence of the market. I find it very frustrating to see this situation unrectified fully seven years after the collapse of the ""bubble"" economy. It is essential that each financial institution promptly make every possible effort to regain its credibility in the markets.

In this respect, I have taken the position that it is desirable to expand the scope of disclosure, and that one possible way of doing this is for individual financial institutions to voluntarily disclose their self-assessment figures. There have been some negative responses to this approach on the grounds that an undifferentiated disclosure of Category II loans under an ambiguous definition may invite misinterpretation by the markets. However, my point is not to promote a uniform, formalistic disclosure of all Category II loans. What I am saying is that it is very important for the financial institutions to provide useful information, which the markets can use as a basis for making judgments, through their own creative approaches to winning the confidence of the markets. Financial institutions should voluntarily show the markets their assessment of credit risk exposures and demonstrate that they are taking appropriate measures to dispose of nonperforming loans by giving convincing explanation. I believe this is highly important to speedily restore both customers' and markets' confidence in not only individual financial institutions, but also the entire Japanese financial system. We are living in an age when domestic and international markets make judgments on the business performance of firms and financial institutions. In this environment, one should not forget that the more accurate and adequate information is made available, the more confidently the markets can form their judgments.

The second key to the disposal of nonperforming loans is to remove bad loans from balance sheets as soon as possible by selling off the loans themselves or the collateral real estate.

This is related to the issue of disclosure which I discussed just now. No matter how rational the methods, valuation of nonperforming loans unavoidably involves some degree of uncertainty. For instance, it is possible that a deterioration in the market conditions will cause the proceeds from the actual sale of collateral real estate to fall short even of a fairly conservative estimate made when loan-loss reserves were set aside. Hence, in order to improve the reliability of the balance-sheet information of financial institutions, it is desirable to identify the amount of potential losses as early as possible.

Various institutional changes are being steadily implemented to develop an environment more amenable to the liquidation of real estate and other assets. It is notable that the Total Plan contains numerous important measures for promoting greater liquidity, such as establishment of a Temporary Council for Coordinating Real Estate-Related Rights, the introduction of due diligence procedures for real estate appraisal, and the creation of a servicer system. Using these new arrangements to separate nonperforming loans from the balance sheet will facilitate a more accurate judgment of the strength and market value of financial institutions, and will thereby open the way to the next step, which is to formulate new management strategies.

The third key is making effective use of public funds to promote the smooth solution of the nonperforming-loan problem without causing disruption and unwanted side effects during the process.

What is most important is to protect the depositors of failed financial institutions. The two financial system-related laws enacted in February 1998 provide for the use of a maximum of 30 trillion yen in public funds. 17 trillion yen of the 30 trillion yen has been earmarked for the Special Account of the Deposit Insurance Corporation for the full protection of depositors.

The other 13 trillion yen has been made available to the new Financial Crisis Management Account of the Deposit Insurance Corporation for such purposes as enhancing the capital base of financial institutions. Of this total, 1.8 trillion yen has already been injected into 21 banks at the end of March following deliberations by the Financial Crisis Management Examination Board. The Total Plan also proposes the establishment of public bridge banks to continue providing loans to sound borrowers of failed financial institutions. A portion of the 13 trillion yen for the Financial Crisis Management Account will go into the capital of the bridge bank holding company, to be known as the Heisei Financial Revitalization Corporation. I believe that the fund can also be effectively used in various other situations. For example, if a financial institution falls into capital inadequacy as a result of thorough disposal of nonperforming loans, or if such a financial institution merges with another financial institution, the fund may be used to protect borrowers from being affected by an extreme deterioration in the institution's lending capacity. Of course, it is essential to prevent moral hazard when using public funds, and due accountability and adequate measures will be required of financial institutions drawing on these funds. As discussion of these matters proceeds, I very strongly hope that disposal of nonperforming loans will accelerate, leading to an early recovery of the financial intermediary functions.

""All Japanese banks"" refers to the member banks of the Federation of Bankers Associations of Japan (Zenginkyo).
C. The Role of the Bank of Japan
Given its position as the central bank, the Bank of Japan will seek to make the maximum possible contribution to the process of disposing of nonperforming loans.

The primary role of the Bank is to safeguard the stability of the financial system by providing adequate liquidity to prevent hindrance of settlements in the financial markets.

For example, the Bank has provided uncollateralized loans, or ""special loans"" (tokuyu), under Article 38 of the Bank of Japan Law of 1997 (Article 25 of the former Bank of Japan Law) as needed to ensure that the failed financial institutions are able to repay deposits smoothly. Currently, the outstanding balance of these special loans amounts to approximately 2.7 trillion yen.

The Bank acted decisively to supply the markets with considerate amounts of reserves when the market's growing concern over the credit risks of financial institutions exerted upward pressures on interest rates. When markets were particularly tense at the end of last year and again in June this year, the Bank's provision of reserves exceeded the amount required under the reserve requirement system by a daily average of 3-4 trillion yen.

It is only when smooth withdrawal of deposits and unimpeded settlement of funds are secured that the anxiety of depositors and the markets is removed, restoring confidence in the stability of the overall financial system. The Bank has worked to achieve this because it is responsible for maintaining the smooth operation of the payment and settlement systems, and it will continue to do its utmost to avoid any problems emerging in this area.

I mentioned earlier that 30 trillion yen in public funds has been made available for financial system measures. Under the scheme, the Deposit Insurance Corporation can obtain funds up to 20 trillion yen through (1) Bank of Japan loans, (2) private financial institution lending, and (3) bond issuance, all of these guaranteed by the government with the aforementioned public funds. Accordingly, the Bank has in fact already provided the Deposit Insurance Corporation with liquidity. Following the principle that the Bank's funds must not be used to cover the losses of financial institutions and must not go beyond the limits of providing temporary liquidity, the Bank is utilizing such schemes to ensure the stability of the financial system.

The second role of the Bank of Japan is to undertake on-site examinations of financial institutions. While such examinations are conducted under bilateral contracts with individual financial institutions, they are given an explicit legal standing under the new Bank of Japan Law.

As I mentioned earlier, to solve their nonperforming-loan problems, financial institutions today are required to undertake loan-loss write-offs and provisioning in accordance with appropriate self-assessment of their assets, and to voluntarily expand the scope of their disclosure. As part of this process, it is very important to increase the objectivity of disclosed information to enhance its credibility in the markets. For this purpose, the Bank of Japan and the Financial Supervisory Agency will cooperate in conducting intensive inspections and examinations of 19 major banks.

The third role of the Bank of Japan derives from a somewhat different viewpoint. It is to implement, where possible, measures to contribute to smooth corporate financing in a situation where the lending attitude of financial institutions is increasingly cautious. As I previously explained, financial institutions have adopted a more cautious lending stance because nonperforming loans have significantly impaired their real capital base. The most effective way to achieve a more accommodative lending stance is therefore to promote increased management efficiency and strengthen financial institutions' capital bases. Injection of public funds stands as a ready tool for achieving this purpose, and as I stated earlier, the Bank of Japan is committed to supporting these initiatives through the supply of requisite liquidity.

But our efforts do not stop here. In its conduct of money market operations, the Bank of Japan has implemented several measures to facilitate the raising of funds by the corporate sector. Last autumn, following the failure of several financial institutions, market anxiety mounted, causing the CP market to temporarily cease to function. The Bank responded to this situation by significantly expanding its CP buying operations to promote an early recovery of the market to normal functioning, and thereby gave indirect support to firms' CP financing.

CP issuance is generally limited to large firms. However, it is conceivable that, if CP buying operations revitalize this market, large firms might shift their funding to CP from bank loans, and as a result, financial institutions might be given more room to meet the financing needs of smaller firms. Thus, I believe that the Bank's action can indirectly have favorable effects on lending from financial institutions to small and medium-sized firms.

I have tried to illustrate how the Bank's market operations can contribute to invigorating the financial markets. The Bank remains committed to implementing carefully considered operations, including maintaining flexible CP operations, particularly toward the end of the semiannual settlement in September, when seasonal corporate demand for funds heightens.

It is also vitally important for the Bank to constantly review its money market operations means, and the collateral involved, in accordance with innovation in financial technology. Last year, the Bank of Japan launched market operations in the ""repo"" market. In the autumn of this year, the Special Purpose Companies (SPCs) Act is scheduled to be enacted to prepare an environment for facilitating the issuance of asset-backed securities (ABS) and asset-backed CP (ABCP). The Bank of Japan must review and update its market operations methods to reflect such ongoing changes and diversification of financial transactions. Not only is this indispensable for attaining greater sophistication in market operations, but these efforts will promote further development of the financial markets, and through this contribute to smoother corporate financing.

As I have outlined, the Bank's response to the issue of corporate financing consists of short-term actions and also measures requiring medium- to long-term consideration. The Bank intends to take both approaches to help advance financial market functions.

III. Current Monetary Policy Management
A. The Current Condition of the Japanese Economy
Thus far, I have explained the key points for the early disposal of nonperforming loans, which is a prerequisite to the recovery of confidence in the financial system, and the role to be played by the Bank of Japan in this process. At the same time, the stability of the economy itself is an essential factor as an environment in which smooth disposal of nonperforming loans can be promoted. For instance, should business conditions further deteriorate, decreased cash flows of firms and lower real estate prices would heighten the probability of an increase in nonperforming loans. At the outset of my remarks today, I mentioned that there is a very close relation between economic conditions and the financial system. Not only does a weak financial system delay and obstruct an economic recovery, it must also not be forgotten that a worsening of business conditions could hinder the solution of the nonperforming-loan problem.

Let us now take a look at the current condition of the Japanese economy. The economy is now at a stage where a weakening of final demand, reflecting anemic private consumption and business fixed investment, is clearly exerting a negative influence on production, corporate profits, and employment and income conditions. Industrial production, affected by ongoing inventory adjustment, marked its third consecutive quarterly decline in the April-June quarter. The outlook for the July-September quarter is also gloomy, as the Bank's interviews with industry sources suggest a strong possibility that the slide will continue. The contraction in production activity, together with weak price developments, has created very harsh conditions for corporate profits. Employment adjustment pressure is also mounting rapidly, particularly in small and medium-sized firms. As a result, Japan's unemployment rate has risen to its highest level since such figures were first compiled in 1953.

In other words, we see at present a negative interaction between production, income, and expenditure. What would this situation have led to in the absence of policy countermeasures? In my view there would have been a real possibility of the Japanese economy falling into a vicious cycle of a further expansion of the output gap leading to declining prices and then to squeezed corporate profits--namely, a deflationary spiral.

In actuality, the government introduced in April a comprehensive economic package in excess of 16 trillion yen, and the supplementary budget for fiscal 1998, which embodied the package, is now being implemented. Parallel action was taken to strengthen the financial system. As I mentioned earlier, in February the government adopted emergency measures to stabilize the financial system, which allowed for the use of a maximum of 30 trillion yen in public funds. In early July, the government and the ruling LDP unveiled the details of the Total Plan. The effects of the special income tax cuts and additional public works contained in the comprehensive economic package will begin to appear in the second half of this year. This leads us to expect that the risk of the economy sinking into a deflationary spiral will be contained, at least for the time being. However, as the level of economic activity is already very low, we are left with little choice but to conclude that the measures will have a limited impact on private demand and that, therefore, they are unlikely to place the economy promptly on a path of self-sustained recovery. My judgment is that, although a deflationary spiral will be averted for the time being, considerable uncertainty remains as to the prospects for the economy after the effects of the comprehensive economic package have played themselves out.

B. Monetary Policy for the Immediate Future
Given these economic conditions, the Monetary Policy Meeting of the Bank of Japan Policy Board convened yesterday decided to keep monetary policy unchanged for the immediate future. I will leave the details of the Board's discussions to the minutes to be published at a later date, but in brief, the majority view expressed in yesterday's meeting was that (1) the risk of the economy slipping into a deflationary spiral would be averted for the immediate future by the effects of the government's comprehensive economic package; (2) therefore, it would be better to maintain the current easy monetary policy rather than to further reduce interest rates from their already extremely low levels; and (3) the Board should closely monitor the unfolding impact of the comprehensive economic package, as well as the influence of progress in discussions on various financial system revitalization measures and tax system reforms on corporate and household confidence.

As you all know, the Bank of Japan has maintained the official discount rate at a historic low of 0.5 percent and has encouraged the uncollateralized overnight call rate to remain, on average, slightly below the official discount rate for nearly three years since September 1995. With interest rates extremely low, there is very little room left to lower them any further. Given this constraint, we constantly face the following two questions in managing monetary policy.

The first question is, ""How effective can a further interest rate reduction be in stimulating the economy?"" Currently, corporate and household confidence is very weak. Under such conditions, a minor cut in interest rates, resulting in only a slightly lower cost of capital and only a small improvement in the financial position of firms, would naturally have only a limited effect on active corporate behavior such as business fixed investment. For the effects of monetary easing to be certain, there needs to be a sizable decrease in interest rates. But given the present extraordinary low interest rate levels, we face the dilemma of having scarcely any room left for a significant cut.

Of course, it can be argued that as long as there is some positive effect, no matter how small it might be, interest rates should be lowered immediately if economic conditions are deteriorating. This brings me to the second question that must be considered: ""Are there no negative aspects to a further interest rate cut?"" For instance, lower interest rates will reduce households' interest income. We then face the question whether consumer confidence, already low, would be further undermined.

There is also the issue of whether lower interest rates would trigger an additional depreciation of the yen, and if so, whether that would be a problem. Under normal circumstances, a weaker yen acts as a channel for transmitting the impact of monetary easing, working positively on the economy. However, depending on the state of market sentiment, the possibility cannot be denied that a depreciation of the yen could, by provoking falls in other Asian currencies against the US dollars and causing a drop in stock prices in tandem, amplify people's anxieties.

To summarize, with today's extremely low interest rates, it is probable that the effects of a further cut in interest rates would not be sufficiently large and, in addition, the side effects of the action might not be negligible. These are essential points that the Board has had to consider in its discussion of monetary policy in the past few months. They do, however, lie beyond the domain of our past experience, and moreover, the effects and side effects of the policy action can vary depending on the prevailing circumstances. Hence, I believe that it would be inappropriate to come to any firm conclusion. The decisions to leave monetary policy unchanged while economic conditions grew progressively harsher each month were based primarily on the judgment that the positive effects of fiscal policies should soon appear. But at the same time, the Board could not escape the question of how to judge the balance between the positive and negative outcomes of an interest rate reduction under the current conditions.

C. The So-Called ""Adjusted Inflation""
In this unusual monetary policy environment, arguments have recently been put forward in some quarters for so-called ""adjusted inflation."" What is meant by this term varies from one user to another, while the question remains whether the term ""adjusted inflation"" is an appropriate expression of the ideas put forward. Let me outline what I believe to be the essence of the arguments, with ""monetary expansion"" and ""inflation targeting"" also in mind. (1) In the current situation, there is limited room for further reductions in nominal interest rates. (2) It is real interest rates--that is, nominal interest rates minus expected rate of inflation--rather than nominal interest rates that actually affect investment decisions. (3) Therefore, the Bank of Japan should adopt a clear stance of allowing a certain level of inflation, raising inflation expectations and thereby lowering real interest rates. (4) The Bank of Japan could indicate its pro-inflation stance by pledging itself to the expansion of monetary aggregates such as money supply or monetary base, or by setting an inflation target. It should be noted, however, that regarding the question of tolerance of inflation, there is a considerable difference between ""adjusted inflation,"" which advocates an active raising of price levels, and ""monetary expansion"" and ""inflation targeting,"" both of which simply emphasize the avoidance of deflation.

There are a wide variety of opinions on this topic both in academic and business circles. At the Bank of Japan, we are also discussing these proposals, but at present we do not have a consensus on all pertinent issues. Having expressed this reservation, I would like to introduce three specific issues which I believe to be of special importance.

My first point relates to the Bank of Japan Law, which explicitly states that the Bank's monetary policy should ""be aimed at contributing to the sound development of the national economy through the pursuit of price stability."" In this context, ""price stability"" refers to ""the absence of inflation or deflation."" It is commonly understood that expectations of inflation or deflation are very difficult to sweep away once they become lodged in people's minds. It is therefore quite unacceptable for a central bank to declare war on inflation at one time and to promote it at another. After all, it is essential that the central bank adhere at all times to the single policy objective of averting inflation or deflation, in order to win the public's confidence in monetary policy. If the ""adjusted inflation"" policy proposal aims, under certain circumstances, at creating a certain level of inflation, then it must be said that this constitutes an untenable option.

But I would like to take this opportunity to state clearly that the Bank does not desire deflation. I ask you to remember that the Bank has for nearly three years now maintained interest rates at extremely low levels for the purpose of avoiding a deflationary spiral.

My second point concerns the relation between a ""lowering of interest rates"" and ""monetary expansion,"" which is often cited as an effective means of increasing people's inflation expectations. We would usually expect that a lowering of interest rates, as it worked its way through the economy, would boost corporate demand for funds, and in turn lead to increased monetary aggregates such as bank lending and money supply. In fact, under the Bank of Japan's ""very easy"" monetary policy, the monetary base--equivalent to the sum of cash and reserve deposits of financial institutions held at the central bank--has recently attained an annual growth rate of nearly 10 percent, helped by a significant increase in banknotes. This also works the other way round. When there is upward pressure on money market interest rates, the Bank of Japan responds by supplying ample funds--that is, ""through monetary expansion""--to contain the pressure on interest rates.

My point is that a ""reduction in interest rates"" and ""monetary expansion"" are basically two sides of the same coin. Therefore, if we should opt for ""monetary expansion"" at some point in the future, we must acknowledge that the action would, at least temporarily, bring about a further decline in short-term interest rates from their current levels. We might see the overnight call rate come down close to zero percent. There are some proposals for ""monetary expansion"" as an alternative to the lowering of interest rates to avoid the various side effects of lower interest rates. This, however, is simply impossible. Thus, if a lowering of interest rates is problematic because it may have an adverse effect on consumer confidence and the yen's exchange rate, then we must realize that ""monetary expansion"" will give rise to exactly the same problems.

The third and last point concerns the assertion that ""monetary expansion"" or ""inflation targeting"" can have a more pronounced impact than an ""interest rate cut"" in that they can work on people's medium-term expectations. Some academic circles, represented by Professor Krugman, claim that even in cases where the nominal interest rate stands at zero percent and therefore cannot be lowered any further, the public's expected rate of inflation will rise if the central bank announces a medium-term commitment to monetary expansion, or if it establishes a specific inflation target. Those taking this position argue that the increase in inflation expectations will stimulate the economy by lowering real interest rates.

However, even if a central bank sets a goal of expanding the money supply or raising the inflation rate, by what means could such goals be achieved when there is so little room for a further decline in interest rates? True enough, it might be possible to increase the monetary base by purchasing large quantities of government bonds and other securities. From that point on, however, there would be tremendous uncertainties. For instance, how much growth can we expect to see in corporate demand for borrowing when there is very little room left to lower lending rates? Similarly, how positive a stance can we expect of financial institutions in regard to stepping up their lending activity when the financial intermediary functions are so weak?

Nevertheless, the Bank of Japan will continue to study and examine the arguments on ""monetary expansion"" and ""inflation targeting,"" as they involve highly important issues concerning policy objectives of the central bank and the formation of medium-term expectations. However, it cannot be denied that significant uncertainties remain with regard to the relation between the objectives, namely a certain level of money stock growth or rate of inflation, and available means for achieving them. These arguments, in the end, bring us back to our initial problem that there is little room for further interest rate declines.

D. Macroeconomic Policy
While I have discussed some important aspects of ""adjusted inflation"", I would like to suggest that if we interpret ""adjusted inflation"" policy to mean ""implementation of measures to stimulate aggregate demand,"" then this would be a policy which the Japanese economy vitally needs today. Considering the general environment for monetary policy which I have discussed, however, I believe that the primary economic policy responses available at this time are inevitably (1) direct demand creation measures centered on fiscal policy, and (2) confidence building measures, including financial system stabilization and structural reforms of the economy.

From this perspective, the comprehensive economic package, the Total Plan, and the ongoing discussions on tax system reforms are very timely indeed, and I strongly hope that steady progress will be made in these areas. It should be noted, however, that if the government is to abide by the framework of the Fiscal Structural Reform Act as it stands now, it is quite likely that the initial fiscal 1999 budget will be restraining in comparison to the total fiscal 1998 budget which included a large-scale supplement. This would not be a problem if the private sector has gained by then enough momentum for a self-sustained recovery. But if it has not, then the economy would be put at the risk of deteriorating again in fiscal 1999, even if downward momentum has been stopped temporarily by the effects of the comprehensive economic package in the second half of this fiscal year.

Needless to say, from a medium- to long-term perspective, improving the efficiency of the fiscal system, or fiscal consolidation, constitutes one of the most important challenges facing Japan today. From this viewpoint, the basic spirit of the Fiscal Structural Reform Act must be fully respected. However, taking into consideration the substantial uncertainties which cloud the prospects for the Japanese economy in fiscal 1999, I earnestly hope that both the new administration and the Diet deliberate thoroughly on the immediate issues that I mentioned, while constantly keeping in mind the medium-term goal of achieving fiscal soundness.

IV. Conclusion
As I have stated, the task of the Bank of Japan is becoming more challenging than ever before in terms of both the financial system and monetary policy.

As you all know, nearly four months have passed since the new Bank of Japan Law came into effect in April. The law states that the Bank's role is to contribute to the sound development of the national economy through ""pursuit of price stability"" and ""maintenance of the stability of the financial system."" I believe that these twin missions are given to the central bank specifically because of the close, indeed inseparable, relation between the economy and the financial system. It seems to me that the importance of this relation has never been so clear as today.

We, as the central bank of this country, are committed to making every effort to achieve swiftly and simultaneously the revitalization of the financial system and the recovery of the economy. In closing, I would like to ask for your support and cooperation.

Thank you very much for your kind attention.",,Neutral,0.4985130131,,
"Sep. 11, 1998",Foreword by the Governor,"It is a pleasure to bring you the Bank of Japan's Annual Review 1998, which summarizes the Bank's policies and various activities in fiscal 1997 and reviews the economic and financial developments in Japan over the course of the fiscal year.

One of the significant changes for the Bank during the fiscal year was the enactment on June 11, 1997 of the new Bank of Japan Law, which became effective on April 1, 1998. The new law establishes a framework for the central bank based on two principles: autonomy in monetary policy and transparency of policy decision-making processes. In accordance with this new law, the Bank commenced Monetary Policy Meetings of the Policy Board and publication of the minutes. Such meetings to discuss monetary policy, held twice a month in principle, were first convened in January 1998, even before the new law took effect, reflecting the Bank's determination to improve its transparency. The Bank's organization has also been altered to improve the efficiency of the Bank's operations.

Looking back on the economic and financial developments, fiscal 1997 was another difficult year for Japan.

In the economy, the positive interaction between production, income, and expenditure weakened, placing increasing downward pressure on economic activity. Economic growth started to decelerate in the spring of 1997 following the rise in the consumption tax rate. In the summer and autumn, turmoil in other Asian economies and financial markets and a series of financial institution failures added to the uncertainty regarding the economic outlook. In these circumstances, household and corporate confidence deteriorated. As a result, private consumption and housing investment remained sluggish, industrial production declined, and business fixed investment slowed. Meanwhile, prices were stable as a whole. To address the stagnant economic situation, the government implemented stimulus measures including a special income tax reduction and additional public investment. At the beginning of fiscal 1998, the government adopted a comprehensive economic package with expenditures totaling over 16 trillion yen. More recently, the new administration is planning to launch new economic stimulus measures, including additional public investment and further income tax reduction. The Bank maintained its easy monetary policy throughout the fiscal year to support the economy.

With regard to the financial system, Japanese financial institutions continued to make steady progress in the disposal of nonperforming loans through active write-offs and provisioning. However, the system also saw a number of financial institution failures during the fiscal year. Failures of large financial institutions in the autumn increased anxiety about the stability of Japan's financial system and heightened market participants' awareness of the credit risk of financial institutions. Meanwhile, financial institutions reinforced their cautious lending attitude. Under these circumstances, the government legislated for the use of public funds to ensure the stability of the financial system and restore the financial intermediary functions. The government has also introduced the Comprehensive Plan for Financial Revitalization (the so-called Total Plan) to promote land transactions and asset securitization as a step toward fundamentally solving the nonperforming-asset problem.

The Bank also took various measures to ensure the sound functioning and stability of the Japanese financial system. To dispel concerns of market participants about the credit and liquidity risks of financial institutions, the Bank provided the money markets with ample liquidity through market operations. In the resolution of the failed financial institutions, the Bank cooperated closely with the parties concerned, making central bank funds available when necessary. To ensure the smooth functioning of the payment and settlement systems, the Bank committed itself to reducing systemic risk through efforts such as the restructuring of its funds transfer system to make real-time gross settlement the only settlement mode by the end of the year 2000. The Bank also supported various private-sector initiatives in reducing settlement risk.

This Annual Review 1998 provides the minutes of the Monetary Policy Meetings, an outline of the Bank's various policy measures and activities, and a detailed analysis of monetary and economic developments in Japan.

I hope that you will find the Annual Review 1998 informative and that it will prove a useful aid to understanding the role and activities of the Bank of Japan as well as the Japanese economy.",,Neutral,0.7824328542,,
"Dec. 22, 1998","Summary of the speech given by Masaru Hayami Governor, the Bank of Japan to the Kisaragi-kai meeting in Tokyo on December 22, 1998 (Recent Economic Conditions in Japan)","Economic Conditions and Monetary Policy Management
Looking at the economy, we have recently seen some bright signs such as an increase in public investment and exports, a deceleration in the decline of production, and, on the financial front some easing of uncertainty with respect to corporate fund-raising over the year-end period.

It is still uncertain at this stage whether such bright signs suggest a recovery from the current vicious circle or just a pause before further hardship. The December ""Tankan"" suggests that the majority view is still one of caution.

While the economy is supported by the public sector, the key to recovery is whether the private sector can regain confidence. However, prospects are not necessarily bright. The environment surrounding business fixed investment and private consumption is not favorable. Prices continue to fall against a widening supply-and-demand gap, and market participants continue to take a cautious view of credit risk and liquidity risk which is reflected in the relatively high interest rates over the financial year-end (the end of March next year).

Under such circumstances, the Bank of Japan is prepared to do its best to support economic activity and financial stability while maintaining the current easy monetary policy.

Since the failure of some financial institutions in the fall of 1997, increasing uncertainty regarding the financial system has had a dampening influence on economic activity. In response, the Bank of Japan has provided ample liquidity to the market including a policy change on September 9 to lower the target call rate.

As a result of strenuous efforts by the Bank of Japan in the face of shrinking economic activity and also rising concern with respect to the financial system, its balance sheet has changed substantially over the year.

For example, the Bank of Japan has provided ample longer-term funds to ease pressure on interest rates over both the calendar year-end and financial year-end. As a result, the balance sheet of the Bank of Japan has expanded by about 40 percent over the previous year.

With a view to facilitating corporate financing, the Bank of Japan expanded its commercial paper repo operation, and in November also introduced new money market operation measures including a temporary lending facility to support corporate financing. As a result, we now observe a higher proportion of private sector debt in the Bank of Japan's balance sheet.

Lastly, in order to maintain financial stability, special lending has increased since last year, which was recently replaced by an increase in loans extended to the Deposit Insurance Corporation.

II. Role of a Central Bank and its Balance Sheet
The questions and criticisms we often receive focus on whether the balance sheet change I just mentioned might impair the financial soundness of the Bank of Japan.

It goes without saying that the fundamental mission of a central bank is to maintain the stability of both prices and the financial system so as to contribute to sound and sustainable growth.

This mission is implemented through banking activities just like commercial banks. For example, what we call money market operations are a combination of the sale and purchase of financial assets. By easing monetary policy, the balance sheet of a central bank increases as it provides funds to the market by purchasing financial assets. Such activities are reflected in changes in the Bank of Japan's balance sheet.

The balance sheet of a central bank is sometimes the focal point of confidence in it. And the kind of balance sheet assets held against liabilities, of which a large proportion is in the form of banknotes, is closely monitored. For example, assets should be liquid enough so that they can be utilized flexibly. They should be sound. There should be enough capital to support any emergency measures.

Some observers have expressed concern over the expansion of the Bank of Japan's balance sheet as a sign of deterioration in its assets. However, the truth is that much of the increase in the balance sheet is due to the aggressive provision of liquidity.

But, we should not take such concern lightly since the perception of a deterioration in our balance sheet may undermine confidence in the Bank of Japan and the Japanese economy. Hence, we have to be very vigilant regarding the expansion of our balance sheet and also its composition.

Having described the importance of the balance sheet of a central bank, I would like to point out three key principles in our portfolio selection.

The first principle is to maintain the soundness of assets. This is achieved by various measures such as securing the Bank of Japan's credit by the creditworthiness of plural entities. For example, our loans are secured by not only the creditworthiness of financial institutions to which we extend loans but also the creditworthiness of the public sector and non-bank private sector that are debtors of the financial institutions. Needless to say, we conduct a strict internal rating of the corporate financial debt we accept. Also, we pay particular attention to avoid the over concentration of risks.

The second principle is to maintain neutrality with respect to resource allocation. If the Bank of Japan holds certain assets excessively, it may not be possible for price making in the market to be conducted normally. Hence, the Bank of Japan must choose assets prudently so that there is no distortion of the resource allocation process in the economy nor any adverse consequences for the financial market.

The third principle is to maintain liquid assets. The Bank of Japan must always be ready to respond to any sudden policy decisions. The assets we hold, therefore, must be such that they can be liquidated at reasonable cost at any time.

Bearing in mind these three principles, we have given our best efforts to implement various measures to accommodate the current policy agenda. For example, the new measures announced on November 13 are intended to ""contribute to facilitating corporate financing activities, both in the lending market and the capital market, while maintaining the soundness of the Bank of Japan's balance sheet.""

III. Some Related Issues
I would like to address some of the often asked questions relating to the balance sheet.

The first question is whether a central bank should primarily hold such safe assets as government obligations. In fact, the Bank of Japan holds a substantial amount of government securities (about 57 trillion yen at the end of November 1998), which comprise two-thirds of our total assets. However, such a high proportion of government obligations in the balance sheet is not necessarily universal. The proportion is higher in the US, but lower in European countries.

Historically speaking, a central bank provides funds by rediscounting bills, which are discounted by commercial banks. Before a huge increase in government bond issuance in Japan, the Bank of Japan resorted to the active use of corporate sector debt, such as bills, when providing funds. When dealing with corporate sector debt, we have to control the risks involved. But, at the same time, we should not forget that actively using corporate sector debt is a traditional monetary operation for a central bank. What is important in our portfolio selection is not whether the assets are government or private sector debt, but to make sure that the assets we acquire should not distort resource allocation in the respective financial markets.

The second question is whether a central bank should deal only with the banking sector. This question focuses on the counterparty of a central bank in its monetary operations. The question seems to arise from the fact that the Bank of Japan actively uses private sector debt, such as commercial paper, which gives the impression of excessive involvement in corporate fund-raising. However, it should be noted that we purchase commercial paper not directly from companies, but from financial institutions. Hence our counterparty has not changed.

However, it is an important issue as to whether we should limit our counterparty only to the banking sector. The European Central Bank appears to deal only with the banking sector, whereas the Fed in the US utilizes a primary dealer system. The counterparty question is related to whether we put emphasis on interbank transactions or open market transactions. If a central bank primarily uses interbank transactions, then the banking sector is a natural counterparty. However, it seems to us that the global trend is toward a preference for open market transactions. In the case of the Bank of Japan, we deal not only with the banking sector but also securities companies and ""tanshi"" companies which have accounts with us and are eligible for money market operations.

The counterparty issue boils down to achieving the effective transmission of monetary policy. I do not think we should restrict our counterparty only to the banking sector, but choose from a wider range of entities to achieve a swift, certain, and maximum policy effect. In this regard, it is important that the short-term financial market, where transactions by a central bank are conducted, should be improved in terms of both quality and quantity. The introduction of a public auction system for the financing bills would be a welcome step in this direction.

The third question is whether we should purchase corporate debt and equity because the Japanese economy is in a critical situation. First of all, I would like to emphasize that a central bank can create liquidity but not capital. There is intrinsically a very strict limit as to the extent to which a central bank can take on private sector risk. By shouldering such risk and seeing a subsequent deterioration in our assets, we might lose the confidence placed in us to fulfill our fundamental mission. Hence, the new Bank of Japan Law (effective April 1998) prohibits the Bank from purchasing equities bearing large credit and price risks. We thus do not think it appropriate to purchase corporate debt and equity.

A related question concerns the acquisition of a large amount of government-guaranteed assets, which raises the question of the acquired assets being fixed for the long term on our balance sheet. For example, loans extended to the Deposit Insurance Corporation are increasing rapidly, but we could not justify extending them longer than necessary simply because they are government-guaranteed. Such loans becoming a fixture on our balance sheet should be avoided because such a situation would become an obstacle to the flexible management of monetary policy, and eventually undermine market confidence through concern over balance sheet deterioration. We, as a lender of last resort, will provide whatever liquidity necessary to the Deposit Insurance Corporation from the viewpoint of securing immediate financial stability. But, at the same time, I would like to emphasize that the Deposit Insurance Corporation should make efforts to replace the loans from the Bank of Japan by issuing government-guaranteed bonds and/or borrowing from commercial banks.

IV. Concluding Remarks
The policy agenda for next year is to rebuild the Japanese economy and financial system. Our role as a central bank is to maintain the current aggressive easy monetary policy and to provide enough liquidity to maintain financial stability.

The underlying problem that the Japanese economy faces is not a shortage of liquidity, but a shortage of capital and a reluctance to take the necessary risks that would help the economy expand. The cure for this is, first of all, to strengthen the capital position of financial institutions so as to revive their function as financial intermediaries. The second is to provide an environment that is more attractive to investors and allows taking risks in the capital market. And the third, the most important factor, is to restore private sector confidence.

January will see the debut of the ""euro,"" resulting in the de facto formation of three currency areas, the dollar, the euro, and the yen. Rebuilding the Japanese economy and financial system in a global context will lay a foundation for the yen to become a more easily usable and more reliable currency.",,Negative,0.7430536747,,
"Dec. 22, 1998","Speech given by Masaru Hayami, Governor of the Bank of Japan, to the Kisaragi-kai meeting in Tokyo on December 22, 1998 (Recent Economic Conditions in Japan)","Introduction
I am truly honored to have this opportunity to speak to you. I will begin with a brief outline of recent economic and financial developments in Japan and then give my thoughts on today's topic, the role and balance sheet of a central bank.

II. Economic Conditions and Monetary Policy Management
A. Current Economic and Financial Conditions
Japan's economy still remains in a severe situation. Recently, however, the pace of economic deterioration has moderated somewhat, thanks to increased public investment and exports. The decline in production has decelerated, reflecting some progress in inventory adjustment. With regard to financial developments, the temporary increase in concern over corporate fund-raising toward the year-end has eased gradually, on account of the government's expansion of credit guarantee system and the Bank's introduction of new market operations measures and lending facilities.

Thus, there have been some bright signs for Japan's economy. However, it is still unclear at this stage whether these suggest an escape from the current vicious circle, or just a pause before further hardship. The results of the December Tankan--Short-Term Economic Survey of Enterprises in Japan--published in mid-December showed that the majority of firms still had a cautious view of the economic outlook.

The key to economic recovery lies in whether private demand can lead to a self-sustained recovery of the economy while the public sector is underpinning it. However, given the continued deterioration in corporate profits as well as employment and income conditions, developments in business fixed investment and private consumption require close attention. Prices continue to be weak, reflecting a widening output gap in the economy. Therefore, it needs to be carefully watched whether or not the implementation of the emergency economic package and other measures will have the intended effect of improving business and household confidence.

In the financial markets, concern over credit and liquidity risks continues to exist. One manifestation of this is the market interest rates on instruments maturing after the fiscal year-end in March 1999, which are likely to remain high.

Under these circumstances, the Bank will maintain the current decisive easy stance of monetary policy, and continue to do its best to support economic activity and financial stability.

B. The Bank of Japan's Balance Sheet
The failure of some financial institutions in autumn 1997 was followed by increased anxiety about the stability of the financial system, which has had a dampening influence on economic activity. The Bank has responded to this situation by implementing a variety of monetary policy measures, including an additional lowering of the target call rate on September 9, 1998 and continued provision of ample liquidity under the relaxed policy stance.

The Bank has also taken the following measures in its money market operations. First, the Bank has injected large amounts of longer-term funds to ease the upward pressure on market interest rates maturing beyond the end of the semiannual accounting term in September and the end of the calendar year in 1998. This has caused the Bank's balance sheet to expand by about 40 percent over the year. Second, the Bank has adopted some new measures to facilitate corporate financing, such as increasing commercial paper (CP) repo operations and introducing a temporary lending facility in November 1998. As a result, there has been a continuing rise in the proportion of private-sector debt to the asset account on the Bank's balance sheet. Third, as part of its efforts to maintain financial stability, the Bank has expanded special lending since 1997 under Article 38 of the Bank of Japan Law of 1997. The function of these loans, which is to provide emergency liquidity to ensure financial system stability, has recently been taken over by loans to the Deposit Insurance Corporation (DIC).

The Bank's balance sheet has thus changed dramatically over the past year. The change is a reflection of the Bank's constant efforts to combat the economic downturn and the increasing uncertainty about financial stability. However, the expansion of the balance sheet has also given rise to a significant number of questions and criticisms focusing on a perceived threat to the financial soundness of the Bank. I would therefore like to devote the rest of my speech to a fairly detailed examination of the Bank's role and its approach to provision of credit, in light of the changes in the Bank's balance sheet.

III. Extension of Credit by the Bank of Japan
A. The Role of a Central Bank and Its Balance Sheet
Before explaining why the soundness of the Bank's balance sheet has become an issue, I need to refer to the mission of a central bank.

In brief, the mission of the Bank of Japan, the central bank of Japan, is to issue banknotes, ensure the functions of the currency, and contribute to the sound development of the Japanese economy. Perhaps ""ensuring the functions of the currency"" sounds a little too abstract. Specifically, the Bank must first ensure the stability of the currency's value, and second maintain an appropriate framework for its circulation. Referring to these two requirements, the role of a central bank is often defined as maintenance of price stability and financial system stability.

On a day-to-day level, the Bank seeks to fulfil its mission by engaging in banking activities that are similar to those of commercial banks. When the economy is experiencing inflation or deflation, the Bank tries to restore and maintain a non-inflationary and non-deflationary situation--that is, a situation of price stability--by influencing the quantity of money in circulation and the levels of various interest rates. The Bank achieves this objective by influencing interest rates in the financial markets. And this is done basically by supplying or absorbing the appropriate amount of funds through the purchase or sale of financial assets. Such activity by the central bank is called ""market operations."" The same is true of the Bank's activities to maintain an orderly financial system. When the stability of the financial system is at risk due, say, to failure of a commercial bank, the Bank of Japan acts decisively to minimize the ensuing disturbance by injecting funds into the system. The principal tool the Bank employs in such cases is lending.

As with commercial banks, the activities of the Bank are clearly reflected in its assets and liabilities shown on its balance sheet. For instance, when the Bank drastically eases money in order to avert deflation, as is the case at present, the Bank increases provision of funds in the markets by increasing its purchase of financial assets. This naturally causes the Bank's balance sheet to expand.

The key question is whether or not people will trust their central bank and be willing to hold the country's currency (including banknotes, which bear no interest). This depends on whether or not the central bank's behavior has measured up to the expectations of the people, and whether or not it continues to do so. One source of clues for making such a judgment is the balance sheet, and it is therefore natural that people in Japan and abroad take a keen interest in the Bank's balance sheet.

The Bank's balance sheet can be discussed from various perspectives. From the viewpoint of people's confidence in a central bank, it is most important that the financial assets the Bank holds are adequate to secure the banknotes issued. This adequacy, I believe, involves two specific points. First, the Bank's assets must be sound and its financial base must be solid--the latter means that the Bank must have a sufficient capital base--in order for the Bank to continue to act decisively as a central bank in total independence of intervention by a third party. Second, the Bank must have a sufficiently liquid asset portfolio to flexibly inject or withdraw funds as necessary.

I believe that the Bank's balance sheet has also attracted growing attention in other countries. Some observers have expressed concern over the expansion of the Bank's balance sheet as a sign of deterioration in its assets. This may be because a rapid growth of the balance sheet is associated in people's minds with an increase in nonperforming assets that need to be disposed of at a substantial loss. But as I stated at the beginning of my speech, setting aside technical factors, the recent expansion of the Bank's balance sheet is primarily the result of active provision of liquidity under the easing policy. Nevertheless, mere suspicion about an erosion of asset quality can be a serious problem if it undermines people's confidence in the central bank and, in turn, in the national economy. Such loss of confidence could, for example, result in Japan's commercial banks and firms paying an unnecessary premium when raising funds in other countries. That is why the Bank recognizes the need to be vigilant against deterioration in its assets. The Policy Board, the Bank's decision-making body, constantly deliberates whether the various measures implemented to fulfil the Bank's mission could jeopardize the Bank's credibility because of the resulting changes in its balance sheet.

B. Three Key Principles of the Bank of Japan's Portfolio Selection
I will next talk about the philosophy that guides the Bank in portfolio selection--in other words, the key principles in selecting a central bank's portfolio. There are three.

The first principle is to maintain the soundness of the Bank's assets. In other words, assets and collateral held by the Bank must be of high quality.

The Bank has devised a number of methods to achieve this. When supplying funds to financial institutions through loans, the Bank acquires financial assets that are trustworthy as collateral. When providing funds through market operations, it purchases financial assets from financial institutions or other sellers based on repurchase (gensaki or repo) agreements. The only exception to this rule for market operations is when the Bank makes outright purchases of government bonds. Thus, the credits provided by the Bank are secured by the creditworthiness of plural entities: not only by the creditworthiness of financial institutions to which the Bank lends directly, but also by that of the government or the entities in the non-banking private sector, which are the issuers of the debt instruments. This approach is common among central banks. At the Bank of Japan, it is called ""the double-name principle.""

Where the collateral for the Bank's loans and the financial assets purchased in market operations are issued by such entities as private-sector firms, the Bank assesses the eligibility of these assets according to its own criteria--that is, its internal ratings--and reviews it at least once a year. If a firm's financial performance deteriorated, the financial debt of this firm would no longer be acceptable as collateral or as an instrument of market operations, even if it had once been deemed to be suitable for such purposes.

Of course, these measures alone are not enough. The double-name principle might reduce the probability of defaults, but taking a firm's debt as collateral is not sufficient if the firm's creditworthiness is bolstered by the support of the commercial bank to which the Bank of Japan is lending. Nor is it desirable for the Bank's assets and collateral to be concentrated in the liabilities of firms in a particular industry. The Bank pays careful attention not only to the soundness of individual assets but the entire portfolio, ensuring that its assets and collateral are not exposed to linkages of risk or excessive risk concentration.

The second principle is to maintain neutrality with respect to resource allocation. If the Bank held an excessive quantity of certain types of financial assets, price making and resource allocation in the market might be distorted. In view of its role in the economy, the Bank should do its best to minimize such influences. The supply of funds by the Bank of Japan in the context of monetary policy management is aimed at influencing the overall level of market interest rates. Furthermore, provision of funds for the purpose of maintaining an orderly financial system is aimed solely at containing systemic risk and preventing disruption of the entire financial system.

The third principle is to maintain liquid assets. The assets of the Bank must be such as can be liquidated at reasonable cost whenever necessary. This is so that the Bank is ready to respond to any sudden policy decisions. In the management of monetary policy, if the Bank is to control interest rates in rapidly moving financial markets, it must be able to acquire or liquidate financial assets instantly in order to supply or absorb funds. The same principle applies to its provision of funds to maintain an orderly financial system. Asset liquidity is vital to the Bank's capacity to make flexible policy responses while maintaining the Bank's financial soundness.

Bearing in mind these three principles that guide the Bank in its selection of assets and collateral, the Bank has made great efforts to adopt new market operations measures and review collateral requirements to accommodate current policy agenda. One example of this is introduction of new market operations tools to contribute indirectly to the development of financial markets. Another is the Bank's ""New Measures for Money Market Operations in Response to the Recent Situations in Corporate Financing Activities,"" decided on November 13, 1998. As stated in the press release, the aim of these measures is to contribute to facilitating corporate financing activities by devising new methods of market operations and lending.

IV. Some Related Issues
Having outlined the Bank's principles, I would now like to examine its approach in more specific terms by addressing some frequently asked questions relating to the balance sheet.

A. Government Debt or Private-Sector Debt?
The first question is whether a central bank should primarily hold safe assets such as government debt. Some believe that holding private-sector debt reduces the quality of the Bank of Japan's assets, and that the Bank should buy more government bonds.

In fact, the Bank already holds a very substantial amount of government securities. Its holding at the end of November 1998, including short-term securities (financing bills, or FBs), amounted to approximately 52 trillion yen. This, together with the government securities worth about 5 trillion yen borrowed through repo operations, accounted for approximately two thirds of total assets. However, such a high ratio is not typical of central banks. In fact, the only central bank having a higher proportion of government securities in its portfolio is the Federal Reserve of the United States. The central banks in continental Europe primarily purchase private-sector debt such as bills and deeds in providing liquidity, and therefore government securities comprise a smaller proportion of their portfolio. The European Central Bank (ECB), which will administer a common monetary policy for the countries participating in the European Monetary Union from January 1999, will also accept both government securities and corporate-sector debt as eligible assets.

Historically, the concept of a central bank dates from when the Bank of England evolved from a commercial bank into a central bank. The traditional activities of central banks have included provision of funds through the rediscounting of bills discounted by commercial banks. Thus, they have long successfully employed corporate-sector debt as collateral for supplying funds by adequately managing the risks involved, although this has not always been easy. Before large-scale issuance of government bonds began in Japan, the Bank of Japan in fact made active use of corporate-sector debt, especially bills, in providing funds.

The important issue in the portfolio selection of a central bank is not the choice between government and private-sector debt, but rather the avoidance of distortions in resource allocation in the respective financial markets. Based on this principle, the Bank intends to make greater use of selected, sound private-sector debt as market operations instruments or as collateral when it deems this necessary to achieve current policy objectives, such as the development of new markets.

B. Transaction Counterparties
The second question is whether the central bank should make direct contact only with the banking sector, and influence the economy indirectly. Some argue that direct contact with the corporate sector is undesirable in that it creates a potential for arbitrary behavior by the central bank, or for the prolongation of the life of inefficient firms.

This is a matter of principle of whether a central bank should limit its counterparties to banks, or whether it should also deal with the non-banking sector.

The concern seems to have originated in the Bank's active use of private-sector debt through such means as expansion of CP repo operations, which may have given the impression that the Bank is excessively involved in corporate fund-raising. But this concern appears to contain a slight misunderstanding. Although the Bank is indeed buying CP--which is a form of corporate-sector debt--through market operations, it buys the CP from financial institutions including banks, and therefore the counterparties in its operations have not changed. Furthermore, the Bank does not specify the individual CP issues to be submitted, but rather the counterparty financial institutions offer issues of their choice from among those deemed eligible by the Bank. Purchasing CP is no different from providing commercial banks with loans on bills in the sense that the Bank supplies funds to commercial banks by refinancing corporate debt.

However, it merits consideration whether participation in market operations and other Bank transactions should be made open to non-bank entities. If we look at examples overseas, it appears that the ECB will carry out its market operations only with banks. In the United States, however, the Federal Reserve conducts market operations with so-called primary securities dealers, many of which are securities companies that do not have accounts at Federal Reserve banks. A key point in considering this counterparty issue is whether the emphasis is on interbank transactions or open market transactions. If a central bank primarily conducts interbank transactions, the counterparty will naturally be the banking sector. Yet it seems that the global trend is a growing preference by central banks for open market transactions. In Japan, the Bank selects counterparties according to its own eligibility criteria from among banks, securities companies, tanshi companies (money market broker-cum-dealers), and other institutions that have accounts with the Bank.

In the final analysis, I think that the rational solution to this issue is not to restrict counterparties to banks, but choose them from a wider range of entities in order to achieve swift and certain permeation of policy effects and adequate control of counterparty risk, while taking into account such factors as changes in the financial structure. It is certainly essential that the money market, where the central bank makes transactions, be sufficiently developed in both qualitative and quantitative terms. In this regard, Japan will soon have a fully fledged FB market with the introduction of a public auction system for FB issues. As such open market transactions expand, leading to diversification of financial services providers, the Bank will review its selection of counterparties in the Bank's market operations.

C. Corporate Bonds and Equities
The third question is whether the Bank should purchase corporate bonds and equities in view of the critical state of the Japanese economy. This argument is based on the fact that the stock market was at one time supported by the public sector's purchase of equities. It is also the view of the advocates of such intervention that, if the Bank is concerned about risks, it can ask for government guarantees.

First of all, I would like to emphasize that a central bank can create liquidity but not capital. There is intrinsically a definite limit to the extent to which a central bank can take on private-sector risk. Assuming such risk and compromising the quality of its assets might impair the Bank's credibility, which is needed to fulfil its mission. This is why the Bank of Japan Law of 1997, like the previous law, does not allow the Bank to buy equities, which are subject to large credit and price volatility risks. Accordingly, the Bank cannot purchase equities and judges that it should not provide funds in a manner that would involve a similar degree of risk. For the same reason, it also believes that it is inappropriate for the Bank to purchase corporate bonds outright and hold them until maturity.

Placement of government guarantees is not a perfect solution. Although this would reduce credit risks, purchase of corporate bonds and equities yet involves another problem--it might lead to the long-term fixing of assets on the Bank's balance sheet. For example, loans extended to the DIC are increasing rapidly, but the Bank cannot justify extending them for a longer term than necessary just because they are government guaranteed. The prolonged holding of such assets would reduce the Bank's flexibility in money market operations. Moreover, if the balance sheet were left expanded, it would arouse concern about a decline in asset quality. In any event, the outcome would be an impairment of Japan's credibility, which would force Japanese banks and firms to pay unnecessarily high financing costs overseas.

In view of the current state of Japan's financial system, the Bank is prepared to provide the DIC with necessary liquidity in order for the corporation to perform its role effectively. However, I believe that the DIC should subsequently secure longer-term funds by swiftly replacing the Bank's loans with government-secured bond issues or commercial bank loans. The Bank must always be ready to carry out flexible money market operations and serve the function of the lender of last resort whenever necessary. And for this, it is essential that the Bank avoid fixing the massive loans to the DIC on its balance sheet.

V. Rebuilding Japan's Economy and Financial System
I hope my remarks today have been able to clarify some of the issues concerning the Bank's balance sheet. Before ending my speech, since the end of 1998 is only a week away, I would like to discuss Japan's policy agenda for the new year and emphasize the Bank's commitment to it.

The most important task for 1999, given the current state of the Japanese economy, will be to rebuild the economy and the financial system. The role of the Bank will be to work relentlessly to (1) support the rebuilding of the Japanese economy by maintaining the current easy stance on monetary policy; and (2) continue to supply sufficient liquidity to ensure the stability of the financial system.

The fundamental problem confronting the Japanese economy is not a shortage of liquidity, but a shortage of capital and reluctance to take the risks that would help economic expansion. The cure for these, as I have stated many times, is firstly to strengthen the capital base of financial institutions and restore their financial intermediary functions, and secondly to act promptly to create in the capital market an environment that makes it easier for investors to take risks. As an essential first step toward improvement in these two areas, household and business confidence must be restored.

In the currency field, January will see the debut of the ""euro."" As a result, the world will have three major currency areas--those of the dollar, the euro, and the yen--each backed by its own giant economic sphere. Overcoming the aforementioned problems is a prerequisite to making the yen more usable and reliable internationally, enhancing its integrity. This is an extremely important step in accomplishing further development of the Japanese economy by utilizing the world's capital and innovative management techniques.

To repeat, the priorities in 1999 will be to rebuild Japan's economy and financial system, and thereby lay the foundation for a globally credible yen. The Bank of Japan is determined to support these efforts through its monetary policy and financial system policy.

"Mar. 18, 1999","Speech by Masaru Hayami, Governor of the Bank of Japan, at the Research Institute of Japan in Tokyo on March 18, 1999 (Recent Monetary and Economic Conditions in Japan)","Introduction
It is a great honor to be invited to the Research Institute of Japan and have the opportunity to speak to you.

I will begin with a brief outline of recent monetary policy management and then give my thoughts on today's topic, the progress toward the revitalization of Japan's financial system.

II. Recent Monetary Policy Management
A. Monetary Easing in February 1999
On February 12, the Bank of Japan decided to conduct a further monetary easing. The new guideline for the Bank's money market operations is to ""encourage the uncollateralized overnight call rate to move as low as possible"" while giving due consideration to avoiding excessive volatility in the markets.

Let me review the economic situation at the time of the decision. The pace of economic deterioration had been moderating since last autumn, supported by the increase in public investment. However, economic activities in the private sector remained sluggish, and business and consumer sentiment was persistently weak. Moreover, the rise in long-term interest rates and the appreciation of the yen against the U.S. dollar since the end of last year had added to the downside risk to the economy. There was concern that, if these trends continued, the economic deterioration would not come to a halt, possibly accelerating once again in the future. In light of these developments, the Bank judged that it would be appropriate to give maximum support to economic activity through monetary policy.

There have been some changes in the financial market since the monetary easing. The overnight call rate has fallen, recently to close to zero percent, reflecting the Bank's provision of ample funds to the market. Money market interest rates on instruments with relatively long maturities, such as one month and three months, have also declined considerably. In addition, long-term interest rates have marked a clear decline, although the monetary easing was probably not the only factor involved. The yen has generally followed a downward trend. Stock prices, as measured by the Nikkei 225 Stock Average, have recovered to around 16,000 yen. We believe that, if these trends in the financial markets continue, they will influence the economy positively through an improvement in returns on investment, a further alleviation of the fund-raising conditions of financial institutions and firms, and a recovery in business and household confidence.

Concurrently, measures such as the injection of public funds into major banks are likely to further advance the reconstruction of Japan's financial system. Also, the effects of the emergency economic package are expected to come out more fully. I strongly hope that the Bank's latest monetary easing, combined with these policy measures, will give substantial support to economic activity.

Given the recent drop in the overnight call rate to close to zero, some market participants have come to think that the Bank of Japan has decided to employ an approach different from past easings, a so-called quantitative monetary expansion. What I would like to emphasize is that interest rates and quantity of money are like two sides of the same coin. It is only natural for the Bank to expect the latest monetary easing to lead to an increase in money stock and other monetary aggregates through changes in the behavior of financial institutions and in demand for funds. And this is nothing more than the normal transmission that the Bank expected with any interest rate cut in the past.

The Bank's intention has merely been to carry out money market operations in accordance with the current monetary policy guideline decided by the Policy Board, which states that the Bank should encourage the uncollateralized overnight call rate to ""move as low as possible."" Of course, the Bank will continue to closely study other possible ways of managing monetary policy. I would like to emphasize, however, that at present the target of policy management is, as it has always been, the overnight call rate, and that the Bank's aim now is to bring this rate down to as low a level as possible.

In inducing declines in the overnight call rate, the Bank is giving, and will continue to give, due consideration to the maintenance of market functions. The recent decline in the overnight call rate has encouraged institutional investors to shift part of their funds to ordinary deposits at banks, thereby causing an approximately 20 percent decrease in the outstanding transaction volume of the call money market. Fortunately, this contraction of the call money market has not hindered smooth settlement of funds. However, considering the recent big changes in the flow of funds, it will be necessary for the Bank to carefully monitor market developments to make sure that they do not impair the proper functioning of the money market.

B. Problems Associated with Government Bond Operations by a Central Bank-- Underwriting and Increasing of Outright Purchases
A number of people have suggested that the Bank underwrite Japanese government bonds (JGBs) or increase its outright purchase of JGBs in easing monetary policy. As I have repeatedly stated, however, it is totally unacceptable for a central bank to adopt measures that could lead to unlimited financing of the fiscal deficit or ones that could be interpreted as such.

As you know, the Bank's basic stance on the outright purchase of JGBs is to keep the amount of operations roughly in line with the long-term trend in increase in banknotes. At present, such operations are carried out twice a month, each in the amount of 200 billion yen.

If the Bank were to change its stance and expand the outright purchase of JGBs without limit, it could very well result in the loss of fiscal discipline, just as could happen with the Bank's underwriting of JGBs.

If a central bank made unlimited purchases of JGBs, the government would of course have no difficulty in funding its fiscal deficit no matter how massive. This would encourage both the public and private sectors to rely on greater-than-necessary stimulative measures financed by a large-scale issuance of JGBs even at the slightest sign of weakness in the economic outlook. Should such massive JGB issuance continue, Japan's economy would only end up having a massive fiscal deficit and an extremely weak supply side in the private sector.

Various shocks are inherent in an economy. Even though there is no need at the moment to consider the risk of inflation, we cannot rule out the possibility of some kind of a ""demand shock"" occurring over the longer term, such as a plunge of the yen and a tightening of global market conditions. If such a shock hits the economy when the supply side of the economy is feeble, firms will be apt to seek desperately the few skilled workers capable of handling new technology, rush to secure rare materials, or race to invest in plants and equipment in order to seize suddenly appearing business opportunities. Supply shortage, by fueling such a nervous psychology, might intensify inflationary pressure even before economic conditions improve noticeably. To contain such inflationary pressure, it would be necessary to drastically tighten monetary policy. As a result, the economy would be forced to go through severe adjustments.

The risk of inflation causing a wide swing of the economy can only materialize in the distant future, but the Bank of Japan, being responsible for maintaining price stability, must always be fully alert to such a risk. It is this strong commitment to maintaining price stability over time that makes monetary policy that could lead to the loss of fiscal discipline unacceptable.

It may be argued that the Bank should disregard the possibility of future inflation at such a time when Japan's economy is plagued by the risk of deflation. On this point, I would like to stress that the Bank of Japan shares the view that inflation is not at all an immediate threat. We are fully aware that the top priority for Japan's economy at present is to dispel the deflationary psychology. It is precisely for this purpose that the Bank further relaxed its monetary policy in February, and the Bank believes that as of now it has taken all necessary measures. The Bank is also determined to maintain an easy monetary policy stance until the economy gets back on a steady recovery path.

In doing so, the Bank of Japan will avoid employing monetary policy measures that might encourage unwarranted expansion of the fiscal deficit, with unwelcome results of some kind in the future. Instead, the Bank will underpin economic activity on the monetary front while maintaining the discipline of a central bank at all times. The reason independence is essential to a central bank is that it is expected to act constantly with a view to stabilizing even the future value of money, not being swayed by short-sighted concerns. The Bank believes that what it should do now is to provide the market with ample funds and, at the same time, take great care to avoid the risk of future inflation.

C. The Importance of Structural Reform
What needs to be done for Japan's economy today is to strengthen the supply side of the economy by restoring the productivity of the private sector, which declined after the collapse of the ""bubble."" This should be achieved while monetary and fiscal policies are underpinning the economy, which means that the time limit may not be so far away. If policies to stimulate aggregate demand continued to be implemented without any progress in structural reforms that should renew the private sector, Japan's economy would become increasingly inefficient and its productivity would decline further. Such an economy would be vulnerable to shocks that could lead to vicious inflation. In order to achieve sustainable economic growth without people anticipating inflation, the private sector should be continually revitalized through innovations and expansion of business frontiers. One obvious example of this is the U.S. economy, which has enjoyed eight years of uninterrupted expansion.

Firms in various industries are becoming increasingly decisive in disposing of the ""negative legacies"" inherited from the ""bubble"" economy in their accounting-year-end settlement in March 1999. These moves can be taken as indicating firms' determination to launch drastic restructuring, and the Bank considers them as a necessary step for reviving the economy. If these efforts to part from the past are accompanied by moves to enhance future activity, it should lead to the ideal picture, in which both structural adjustment of industry and an overall economic recovery are achieved smoothly.

The problem, as things stand today, is the persistence of the risk that the rapid disposal of ""negative legacies"" will proceed in the absence of sufficient constructive moves, strengthening the deflationary tone of the economy. However, various efforts are starting to be made by firms and the government toward structural reform, and I hope such efforts will gradually bear fruit.

The dynamic process of divesting the economy of its old systems and giving birth to new ones unavoidably involves great uncertainties. Therefore, it is also essential to reconstruct Japan's financial system as promptly as possible to support the activities of firms facing this dynamic process.

Bearing in mind the significance of financial system reconstruction, I would now like to talk about the Bank's thoughts on this issue.

III. Progress Toward the Reconstruction of Japan's Financial System
A. The Current Condition of Japan's Financial System
It has been approximately nine years since Japanese stock prices peaked in late 1989 and approximately seven years since land prices began to fall. Meanwhile, a vast amount of money has been used to tackle the nonperforming-loan problem of financial institutions. It is truly regrettable that this problem has not been completely resolved as yet.

Today, the linkage between financial markets in Japan and abroad has strengthened significantly due to the unprecedentedly rapid globalization and computerization of financial services. Therefore, once a shock arises in one market, there is very serious risk that it will infect other markets. This is precisely why not only Japan but also other countries desire an early solution of Japan's nonperforming-loan problem and the restoration of the credibility of Japan's financial system.

Needless to say, the parties concerned have made very great efforts to resolve the problem. In fact, with the enactment of the Financial Function Reconstruction Law and the Financial Function Early Strengthening Law of 1998, great progress has been made in establishing an institutional framework. The stage is now set for the actual task of unflinchingly cleaning up the nonperforming loans.

I have repeatedly stressed the need for enhancing the capital base of Japanese financial institutions, based on my thinking that the fundamental issue behind the deterioration in the credibility of individual institutions and the financial system as a whole is insufficient capital. In this regard, I truly appreciate the government's decision to inject large amounts of public funds into major banks as a significant step toward restoring the credibility of financial institutions. This alone, however, is not enough to solve the problem. The Bank strongly hopes and expects that financial institutions will continue to do their utmost to remove nonperforming loans from their balance sheets and also to restructure their businesses within the context of the restructuring of the entire financial sector.

In the past several years, the United States and Europe have witnessed large-scale mergers and business tie-ups of financial institutions, which illustrate the dynamic competition in the global financial market. There have been mergers and alliances across business and national boundaries in efforts to respond to European unification or to enter new business areas. Meanwhile, similar moves in Japan have been limited. However, the very recent trend toward diverse alliances and reorganizations, which was in part triggered by the injection of public funds, merits attention. It is clear that financial services are becoming greatly diversified driven by deregulation and innovation in information technology. Under these circumstances, the management of financial institutions is required more than ever to establish effective strategies for selection of areas in which they can find comparative advantage and invest management resources, and for efficient supplementation of their weak business areas. In order to achieve corporate objectives, it may be more effective in certain instances not to limit alliance partners to Japanese institutions. These considerations, in my view, should lead to still greater reorganization of the global financial community.

B. Lessons Learned from Experience
One of the most important issues for Japan today is how to establish an efficient and stable financial system that can fully perform financial intermediation as well as other functions required in the 21st century. Japan is still in the process of resolving the nonperforming-loan problem. Therefore, the lessons that will ultimately be learned from it is not yet known. Nevertheless, I believe it is meaningful to go over the lessons we have learned to date from our experiences in order to successfully build a new financial system.

In my view, we have learned that Japan should have reviewed its principles to place emphasis on risk management and should have utilized the market mechanism much sooner than it actually did, in response to the changes in the conditions surrounding financial industry. Now, in order to catch up with the rest of the world, Japan needs to accelerate this review of principles.

The first concrete factor behind the delay in the review of principles was the inadequacy of the risk management systems of Japanese financial institutions. During the ""bubble"" economy in the late 1980s, Japanese financial institutions expanded their lending in pursuit of larger profits without satisfactory risk management systems. In retrospect, the insufficient scrutiny of the possibility of land price declines and concentration of loan exposure to the real estate-related industry were manifestations of the absence of basic credit risk management. During this period, major financial institutions overseas were in fierce competition to improve their risk management techniques not only for credit risk but also for market risk. The great damage Japanese financial institutions suffered after the collapse of the ""bubble"" economy merely exposed their inadequate risk management.

The second factor was the ineffectiveness of the market's checks and balances, or put another way, the deficiency of a system that should encourage the working of this mechanism. One reason for this was the extremely cautious stance of the parties concerned toward disclosure. For example, the prevalent view until not so long ago was that disclosing the amount of nonperforming loans required careful consideration because it might destabilize the financial system. The accounting system and accounting practices have also tended to obscure the actual business condition of financial institutions. These increased the opaqueness of management of financial institutions and, contrary to the expectations of the parties concerned, spurred the deterioration in the credibility of Japan's financial system as a whole.

The third factor was the monetary authorities' insufficient response to the changes in the financial markets. We had historically relied on detailed regulations and one-on-one guidance to financial institutions in maintaining the stability of the financial system. It is true that these methods had worked for a long time. However, it also seems that they allowed Japanese financial institutions to be indifferent to risk management and to their own responsibilities, and encouraged their ""do-as-everyone-else-does"" philosophy.

Under this so-called ""convoy system,"" Japanese financial institutions offered very similar financial services. It is a fact that there was little incentive to differentiate themselves from their rivals. There was no competition, and even if a financial institution developed a new product, the regulatory system tended to prevent the innovator profiting as he deserved.

The conventional principles might have remained viable, had the financial industry remained static. However, innovation in financial technologies has been dramatic. It is no longer possible for a fine-meshed net of regulations to keep up with the rapidly evolving financial transactions and markets, and to ensure unaided the soundness of financial institutions. This is why it is necessary to establish new principles based on self-responsibility and on the market mechanism.

C. Establishment of New Principles
1. Issues toward April 2001
At present, the Japanese government provides a comprehensive safety net to the financial system effective until March 31, 2001. The safely net is composed of (1) a framework to recapitalize financial institutions with public funds; (2) full protection of deposits and other financial institution liabilities; and (3) a scheme to establish bridge banks or temporarily nationalize troubled banks. These measures are essential given the current severe situation of the Japanese financial system. However, we believe that unnecessary prolongation of these measures will be inappropriate, because they have the potential of causing (1) an increase in social cost, including the amount of public funds used; (2) moral hazard on the part of depositors and financial institutions; and (3) further delays in solving the nonperforming-loan problem. Moreover, they are totally incompatible with the principles of Japan's financial ""Big Bang,"" which are ""free, fair, and global.""

I do not mean to say that from April 1, 2001 onward resolution of financial institution failures should in every case involve execution of the so-called ""payoff,"" that is, payment of deposit insurance benefits. What is important as we move toward April 2001 is for individual financial institutions to improve the quality of their balance sheets and strengthen their capital base. At the same time, we must design and build a safety net based on the new principles of financial business, which I will discuss in more detail later, and also on the lessons learned from past examples of financial institution failures. The scheme should incur the minimum social and economic costs, be able to promptly solve problems, and fit the financial system of the 21st century.

2. Emphasis on risk management
The foremost among the new principles is to place emphasis on risk management. As suggested by the expansion of derivatives transactions, financial transactions are sure to continue to undergo rapid changes. Especially for major banks that are exposed to keen competition in international financial markets, adequate risk management will require constant efforts to keep up with financial innovation. Needless to say, the management of financial institutions needs to fully understand the substance and nature of the information derived from the risk management system, and effectively use the information in making its management decisions.

3. Utilization of the market mechanism
The second is to utilize the checks and balances of the market and to build into the financial system a mechanism that ensures the system's stability. A prerequisite for this is disclosure of more information to the market, which means more transparent financial institution management.

In this regard, it is most important to revise the accounting system. Assessment criteria for nonperforming loans and standards for loan write-offs and loan-loss provisioning are now under review. At the same time, vigorous preparations must also be made for mark-to-market accounting, which is soon to be introduced. The new accounting system is expected to increase the transparency of the balance sheet of financial institutions. Furthermore, it is expected to make financial institutions aware of the risks they are taking by helping them better understand their own financial condition.

For greater transparency of financial institution management, as the Bank has been stressing for some time now, voluntary expansion of the scope of disclosure of an institution's financial condition is also important. Enhanced disclosure may at times mean forcing financial institutions to reveal their unsolved problems. Even so, past experiences teach us that it is more effective in securing the trust of the market to honestly admit the existence of problems and declare how such problems will be solved than to conceal such information. It is also important for the management to explain in its own words the management policy in order to win the trust of the market. Financial institutions should consider disclosure not as a duty but as an opportunity to earn a good reputation with the public, and make active use of such opportunities. Once a pioneering financial institution makes such disclosure, others will follow suit or even improve the content of the disclosure. This will unleash a dynamic competitive process.

Utilization of the market mechanism and increased sophistication of risk management will provide a means of detecting a deterioration in the health of financial institutions. It will therefore not only reduce the cost of regulating and supervising financial institutions but should also lessen the burden on the safety net by preventing failures.

D. Response of the Bank of Japan
The Bank of Japan believes that it has done its best to counter financial institutions' nonperforming-loan problem within the existing institutional frameworks by, among other things, fulfilling its role as the lender of last resort. However, the Bank needs to continue to examine unceasingly the role a central bank should play based on its experiences in battling the present financial crisis.

1. The failure of Nippon Credit Bank
From this perspective, the first incident we should examine carefully, I believe, is the case of Nippon Credit Bank. The temporary nationalization of this failed bank is likely to cause the Bank of Japan to lose the 80 billion yen it subscribed to the bank's capital through the New Financial Stabilization Fund. In April 1997, when Nippon Credit Bank drew up its restructuring plan, there was no safety net with which to deal with its management problems. Nor was there a consensus that bank debentures could be protected by the deposit insurance system. Accordingly, there was a strong concern that, if the bank failed, it would seriously disrupt the financial system at home and abroad. The Bank of Japan therefore made a difficult decision to use the New Financial Stabilization Fund. I believe that this was the only choice the Bank had to safeguard the financial system. Unfortunately, subsequent developments have made it quite probable that the money subscribed by the Bank of Japan could be lost. The Bank regards this as a grave situation.

Based on this experience, the Bank believes that it has to further clarify its policy on the provision of funds for the purpose of maintaining an orderly financial system. Specifically, the Bank will have to define in more detail the criteria for assessing the fulfilment of the existing four conditions for funds provision: (1) there is a threat of systemic risk materializing; (2) there is no alternative to the provision of central bank funds; (3) appropriate measures will be taken to prevent moral hazard; and (4) the financial soundness of the Bank of Japan will not be impaired. Now that a safety net, including a scheme to enhance the capital base of institutions with public funds, is in place, the Bank of Japan should be even more discreet in its capital subscription, or the provision of risk capital. The Bank has learned valuable lessons from the disturbances in the financial system associated with the birth and collapse of the ""bubble"" economy and from its own responses to the disturbances, including the failure of Nippon Credit Bank. These lessons will always be remembered by the Bank of Japan and referred to in making decisions in the future. I believe this is a responsibility assigned to us by the new Bank of Japan Law, which came into effect in April 1998.

2. Review of the Bank's on-site examination and off-site monitoring of financial institutions
Given the changing environment surrounding the financial industry and the Bank's experiences in dealing with financial institution failures, the Bank recognizes the need to review its on-site examination and off-site monitoring of financial institutions from a broad perspective. It cannot be denied that examinations and monitoring by the Bank during the ""bubble"" period were not fully successful in accurately grasping the financial condition of financial institutions or, based on their findings, in prompting the Bank to take necessary steps to warn other parties of the situation.

A central bank implements its policy through banking transactions. Therefore, its on-site examinations and off-site monitoring, which are designed to accurately grasp the financial condition of individual transaction counterparties, are important starting points for execution of its policy. They are also essential in order for the Bank to accurately identify the risks in the overall financial system and the possibility of their materialization, and thereby prevent disruptions in the financial system.

In conducting on-site examinations, we will continue to place emphasis on the assessment of the financial strength and risk management systems of institutions. In addition, with a view to adapting to the changing environment surrounding financial institution management, the Bank will become more flexible in determining the frequency of examinations and will carry out ""targeted examination,"" which focuses on specific areas of business and management. The Bank also intends to follow the condition of financial institutions on a continuous basis through a closer integration of on-site examinations and daily off-site monitoring. The Bank believes that the integration should also reduce the regulatory burden on financial institutions.

The Bank will also make public as far as possible the findings of its research and studies on the overall financial system based on the information obtained through examinations and daily monitoring. By doing so, we hope to assist the advancement of financial institutions' risk management techniques.

3. Loans to the Deposit Insurance Corporation
Now, I would like to add a word on the Bank of Japan's lending to the Deposit Insurance Corporation (DIC). The Bank's lending to the DIC has increased significantly reflecting the massive funding needs of the DIC in proceeding with the resolution of the nonperforming-loan problem of financial institutions. Moreover, it has become very likely that this loan exposure will be fixed for an extended period of time. The very function of a central bank is to implement monetary policy through the purchase and sale of short-term, liquid financial assets. A sizable increase in fixed assets might not only cause concern about a deterioration in the central bank's assets but also become a great impediment to the execution of monetary policy and money market operations. The Bank therefore regards the problem to be a very serious one. It is extremely unusual by international standards for a central bank to provide funds to facilitate the operation of the deposit insurance system. In fact, there has been no such case in the major industrialized countries. Therefore, the Bank of Japan believes that the DIC, in raising funds, should first turn to the private sector and, for example, issue bonds, limiting its borrowing from the Bank of Japan to a bare minimum.

Needless to say, given the present condition of the Japanese financial system, the Bank of Japan will not hesitate to provide short-term funds necessary for the smooth operation of the DIC. However, for the reasons I have just described, I wish to stress that the DIC should first seek to raise funds through means other than Bank of Japan loans, and make it clear that central bank money can be used only as temporary bridge funds. In order to avoid taking on long-term fixed assets, the Bank of Japan is deliberating whether to review the lending rate applied to the DIC, which to date has been the same as the official discount rate, to reflect the lending rates charged by private financial institutions.

IV. Conclusion
The Japanese financial system has been in an unprecedented crisis. This can be viewed as a painful process of transformation of the financial sector from a heavily protected to a competitive industry that generates new know-how and income.

The path of this transformation will not be smooth. However, emerging moves on the part of financial institutions to undertake decisive restructuring and reorganization, and the fact that these institutions still possess sufficient potential in terms of management resources, including human resources, firmly convince me that it will not be too long before they revive as a fully competitive industry, in terms of quality rather than quantity, and driven by foresight rather than hindsight.

"May 14, 1999","Speech by Sakuya Fujiwara, Deputy Governor of the Bank of Japan, at the International Conference on Central Banking Policies, on May 14, 1999 (Soundness of Financial Systems)","Introduction
Good afternoon, Ladies and Gentlemen.

I am pleased to have this opportunity to address the distinguished participants of the International Conference on Central Banking Policies.

Today, under the topic of ""Soundness of Financial Systems,"" I will first discuss how the Bank of Japan has been dealing with the non-performing loan problem of Japanese banks. Then, I will discuss risk management and market mechanisms, making use of the lessons learned during the process of dealing with the non-performing loan problem. In so doing, I will outline directions for the establishment of an efficient and stable financial system for the 21st century. And lastly, I will say a few words about the Bank of Japan's responses.

As I will elaborate upon later, Japan is still in the process of overcoming its non-performing loan problem, and thus it might be premature to derive any final lessons from the process. Nevertheless, I believe that summarizing the lessons learned so far will provide significant clues for establishing a new financial system. I also hope that our experiences might somehow help other Asian countries in solving their own non-performing loan problems.

1. Current State of Japan's Non-performing Loan Problem
Let me first review the current situation regarding Japan's non-performing loan problem. In dealing with it, we have already incurred enormous costs, both in terms of time and financial resources. Time-wise, almost seven years have passed since the collapse of the ""bubble"" economy, which saw real estate prices start to fall, and deposit insurance first being applied to deal with a failed small regional financial institution.

The costs already add up to some 70 trillion yen, about 14 percent of GDP, and mostly cover the losses incurred by financial institutions in the process of disposing of non-performing loans. We expect to incur further costs, totaling several trillion yen, before the temporarily nationalized Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan and Nippon Credit Bank, both former international players, see their balance sheets cleaned up and are handed over to sound recipients.

Taking into account the long period of time and the enormous amount of financial resources used in dealing with the problem, it is quite regrettable that we have not yet seen the end of the problem. One reason for this is the continuing stagnant economy and decline in land prices, which led to additional losses in non-performing loans of financial institutions. Needless to say, in retrospect, more prompt measures to solve the problem would have been desirable.

With the financial industry becoming more globalized and increasingly relying on information technology, we recognize that there is a stronger linkage between domestic and international markets. But with this comes a greater contagion risk of financial instability in one part of the world spreading to other parts through such linkage.

In other words, we recognize that an early solution to Japan's non-performing loan problem is imperative, not only for Japan but also for other nations, especially our Asian neighbors. Our frequently repeated claim that we will never trigger international financial instability comes from this recognition.

Bearing in mind this recognition, the authorities in Japan have been exerting their best efforts to solve the problem. In particular, the legal framework to deal with the non-performing loan problem made progress last year with the enactment of two laws, one regarding reconstructing failed financial institutions and the other regarding strengthening weak financial institutions through capital injection.

With the institutional framework in place, we have now entered a phase where we can implement necessary measures to combat the non-performing loan problem with steadfast resolve.

The Bank of Japan has repeatedly emphasized the need for enhancing capital base, in the belief that the undercapitalized state of financial institutions is the main reason behind the diminishing market credibility of Japanese financial institutions and the financial system as a whole. In this regard, we welcome the considerable capital injection of public funds into the major banks at the end of March, and further welcome the possibility of injecting capital into regional banks.

However, capital injection alone will not solve the entire problem. Not only must banks themselves make every possible effort to remove non-performing loans from their balance sheets, but they must also revitalize their management under the trend toward consolidation.

The current comprehensive safety net will be effective until the end of March 2001. It includes a framework for capital injection using public funds, the full protection of deposits and other claims on banks, and a scheme to establish public bridge banks or temporarily nationalized banks. While these measures are absolutely necessary at the moment considering the current precarious state of Japan's financial system, financial institutions should never become complacent. It is important that they should become more self-reliant and disciplined.

In this context, discussions have already started regarding whether these measures should be extended beyond the March 2001 deadline. At the Bank of Japan, we consider it inappropriate to extend the present safety net measures beyond April 2001 too easily, because, if we did, it would increase the social cost, create moral hazard for depositors and financial institutions, and further delay final resolution of the non-performing loan problem. It is also incompatible with Japan's financial Big Bang principles of ""free, fair, and global.""

We will continue our efforts to establish an appropriate safety net after April 2001. But at the same time, as we move toward April 2001, it is important for individual financial institutions to improve their financial condition and strengthen their capital base, so that they do not have to rely on the safety net. And this takes me to the second subject of my talk, which is risk management.

2. Focus on Risk Management and Making Use of Market Mechanisms
As I just suggested, the safety net we have in mind for the 21st century would incur minimum social and economic costs, while at the same time being able to promptly solve any problems. This is not an easy thing, but in considering the question, let me express my views on what lessons can be derived from our experience of dealing with the non-performing loan problem.

The most basic lesson is that once a ""bubble"" economy has emerged, it will impose enormous economic costs on the public for a long time. Therefore, appropriate macroeconomic policy is important in preempting the formation of a bubble. Bearing in mind that the topic of this conference is ""Soundness of Financial Systems,"" here I would like to point out that in order to ensure financial system stability under a rapidly changing environment, the focus must be on the risk management of financial institutions and the utilization of market mechanisms. I will say a few words about each.

First, risk management. During the ""bubble"" economy of the late 1980s, Japanese financial institutions tended to pursue a policy of quantitative expansion without appropriate risk management. In retrospect, insufficient scrutiny of the possibility of land price declines and the concentration of loan exposure to the real estate-related industry were manifestations of the absence of basic credit risk management.

During the same period, major financial institutions overseas made intensive efforts to improve their risk management techniques, covering not only credit risk but also market risk, which resulted in strengthening their competitiveness in the global market. In contrast, the loss of competitiveness of Japanese financial institutions after the collapse of the ""bubble"" economy highlighted their inadequate risk management.

Conclusions obtained from analyzing past failures only underline the need for Japanese financial institutions to focus more on risk management. Even without referring to the expansion of derivative transactions, financial transactions will certainly continue to change rapidly. For internationally active banks exposed to intense competition in international financial markets, risk management will never reach a point where they can say ""enough."" Instead, they must make continuous efforts to keep up with the pace of financial innovation. In addition, in deciding policy, management must thoroughly understand and make use of the information derived from their risk management systems.

The second focus I mentioned with respect to ensuring financial system stability was market mechanisms. Here I am reminded of the ineffectiveness of the market's checks and balances, or put another way, the deficiency of a system that should have encouraged the working of such mechanisms. One reason for this was the extremely cautious attitude of the parties concerned toward disclosure. For example, the dominant view used to be that ""disclosing the amount of non-performing loans required careful consideration because it might induce disturbance in the financial system."" In addition, the accounting systems and practices tended to obscure the real business condition of financial institutions. Such circumstances increased the lack of transparency with respect to the management of financial institutions, and, accordingly, accelerated the deterioration in the credibility of Japan's financial system as a whole.

By utilizing the checks and balances of the market, we need to devise ways to build a mechanism that ensures the stability of the financial system itself. This requires, above anything else, more transparency on the part of management of financial institutions by providing more information to the market.

In this regard, the accounting system needs to be improved. Recently, the criteria used to assess non-performing loans have been revised, as have the standards for loan write-offs and loan-loss provisioning. Vigorous preparations must also be undertaken for mark-to-market accounting, which is soon to be introduced. The new accounting system is expected to increase the transparency of financial institutions' balance sheets. Furthermore, it is expected to make financial institutions aware of the risks they are taking by helping them better understand their own financial condition.

For greater transparency of management, it is important to voluntarily expand the scope of disclosure, as the Bank of Japan has been stressing for some time. Enhanced disclosure may at times mean forcing financial institutions to reveal their unresolved problems. However, past experience has taught us that, in order to ensure the credibility of the market, it is more effective to honestly admit the existence of problems and explain how such problems will be solved, than it is to conceal such problems.

Financial institutions should consider disclosure not as a duty but as an opportunity to enhance their reputation with the public. Once a pioneering financial institution makes such disclosure, others will follow suit, or even improve the content of disclosure. This will unleash a dynamic competitive process.

Let us now turn to the policy response of the monetary authorities. I daresay we have not necessarily been able to successfully respond to the changes in the financial markets. In order to maintain the stability of the financial system, we used to rely on measures such as detailed, ex-ante regulations and one-on-one guidance to financial institutions. While it is true that such measures worked for a long period, it also seems we allowed financial institutions to be indifferent to risk management and their own responsibilities, thereby passively encouraging their ""do as-everyone-else-does"" attitude.

Under such a system, Japanese financial institutions offered very similar financial services. The regulatory system tended to prevent the innovator from profiting, as he deserved, if a financial institution developed a new product.

The conventional system might have remained viable had the financial industry remained static. However, innovation in financial technology has been dramatic. It is no longer possible for a fine-meshed net of regulations to keep up with rapidly evolving financial transactions and markets. Therefore, for financial system stability, we need to establish new principles based on self-responsibility and market mechanisms.

Making use of market mechanisms and increased sophistication of risk management will provide a means of detecting deterioration in the health of financial institutions. This would not only reduce the cost of regulating and supervising financial institutions, but also lessen the burden on the safety net by preventing failures.

3. Response of the Bank of Japan
The Bank of Japan believes that it has done its best to counter the non-performing loan problem within the existing institutional framework, among other things, by fulfilling its functions and executing measures, including its role as lender of last resort.

In providing funds to maintain the stability of the financial system, we apply four criteria. First, there must be a real threat of systemic risk materializing. Second, there is no alternative to the provision of central bank funds. Third, appropriate measures must be taken to prevent moral hazard. And fourth, the financial soundness of the Bank of Japan must not be impaired. Bearing in mind these criteria, it is necessary to take measures on a case-by-case basis when dealing with individual financial crises. Therefore, it is quite difficult to come up with one single answer for all situations. We must continue to unceasingly examine the role a central bank should play, and to take appropriate measures.

The Bank of Japan conducts on-site examinations and off-site monitoring of financial institutions holding current accounts with it. Because a central bank implements its policy through banking transactions, we believe that on-site examinations and off-site monitoring, through which a central bank accurately grasps the financial condition of individual counterparties, are important starting points for policy implementation. They are also essential for the Bank to accurately assess the ""macro risk profile,"" that is, the existence of risks to the overall financial system and the possibility of their materializing, and thereby prevent disruption of the financial system.

In formulating and implementing policy, the Bank of Japan will also utilize the findings of its research and studies on the overall financial system, based on the information obtained through examinations and daily monitoring. Furthermore, we intend to publicize those findings, to the extent possible, in order to assist the advancement of financial institutions' risk management techniques.

From the viewpoint of financial system stability, we also have an important role to play in reducing settlement risk, which includes improving BOJ-NET, the Bank of Japan Financial Network System. In this context, we are currently restructuring BOJ-NET to make real-time gross settlement, or RTGS, the only settlement mode for fund transfers and for the settlement of Japanese government bonds, by abolishing the designated-time settlement mode. RTGS is one of the essential methods for preventing the failure of one participant from spreading throughout the whole system, in other words, preventing systemic risk. In addition, to reduce settlement risk in foreign exchange transactions, we will extend the operating hours of BOJ-NET's on-line services. This will be accomplished by the end of next year, when BOJ-NET is scheduled to shift to RTGS.

Of more immediacy is the Y2K problem, which we are also actively addressing. Through on-site examinations focusing specifically on the problem, and through three external tests conducted between BOJ-NET and financial institutions and private-sector payment and settlement systems since the end of last year, we have confirmed that Japanese financial institutions are successfully dealing with this problem. We plan to conduct three more external tests this year, including one this weekend. Since the associated risk may not be eliminated completely, we have tried to support Japanese financial institutions' crisis management efforts by publishing the ""Guidance on Year 2000 Contingency Planning"" report last November. We have also made public an outline of our own contingency plan. Needless to say, we will continue to take all possible measures to cope with the Y2K problem.

Concluding Remarks
As I mentioned at the beginning, Japan's financial system finds itself in a never-before experienced situation, which can be regarded as the painful process of the transformation of the financial sector from being heavily protected to being a competitive industry that generates innovation and profits.

The path of this transformation will not be smooth. However, emerging moves on the part of financial institutions to undertake decisive restructuring and consolidation, the fact that the monetary authorities have explicitly committed themselves to reconstructing the financial system, and household financial assets of 1,200 trillion yen, firmly convince me that it will not be too long before Japanese financial institutions recover their competitiveness. Should I have the opportunity to address you once again in the future, I hope the title of my speech will be ""How Japanese financial institutions recovered.""

Thank you for your attention.",,Positive,0.6152650714,,
"May 27, 1999","Speech by Yutaka Yamaguchi, Deputy Governor of the Bank of Japan, at the Hong Kong Trade Development Council Financial Conference on Asia 99 in Hong Kong, on May 27, 1999 (Financial Instability from a Japanese Perspective)","Good afternoon, Ladies and Gentlemen.

I am honored to be invited to this conference and to be given the opportunity to speak to this panel of distinguished participants.

Japan is one country in the region that has been undergoing serious financial strains, although the nature of the problem can be distinguished from that of our neighbors. Most importantly, while the Japanese yen has been exposed to occasional pressures through the years of financial difficulties, yen's situation has been nowhere near a currency crisis that features the region's developments since the summer of 1997. Obviously, a currency crisis would have fundamentally changed the way macro-economic policies have been formulated in Japan.

The list can go on to cover other differences as well. Nonetheless, when a country unfortunately has to face a major systemic crisis, at least some of the basic ingredients to be contained in the policy prescription as well as the general background appear to be surprisingly common. It is also worth noting that the crisis unfolded in the common playground called globalized financial markets. The conditions there have to be taken into account as we jointly make efforts to revitalize the national and international financial systems. It is in this context that I start from Japan's recent history of financial difficulties.

One of the bitter lessons to be drawn from Japan's experience is the rather obvious: a problem cannot be resolved without correctly identifying it. It is now clear that the heart of the problem is the critical erosion of capital of the banking system. In a market where bank credit had been poured into property and other asset markets, large depletion of capital was an inevitable consequence when asset prices collapsed by two-thirds or more. When undercapitalization becomes system-wide, threatening the very survival of a nation's banking system, public assistance has to step in. Needless to say, such a public program has to be carefully designed so as not to leave behind the seeds of moral hazard.

The political process to arrive at public assistance for the banking system tends to be invariably painful. It is not apparent to the general public why the banking industry is entitled to receive what appears in their eyes a special treatment. Large funding requirements using taxpayers' money invites resentment. For these and other reasons, it took several years plus bouts of bank runs in my country before a political consensus was formed in October 1998 to substantially strengthen the safety net. The October package included a major bank recapitalization plan along with the legal underpinnings to deal with failing institutions and as such was recognized by the markets as a belated but serious attempt to address the magnitude of the problem. With the prospective recapitalization in sight, crisis sentiment in the markets subsided, but only after inflicting damage to economic activity.

In light of the prolonged process in Japan to address the problem, improvements to avoid repeating recent history are clearly called for in a number of areas, of which I would mention just a few. Proper assessment of systemic problems at an early stage is crucial. To this end, interactions between economic activity, financial markets, and international capital flows have to be more deeply explored. Also, prudential research at central banks and supervisory authorities needs to be strengthened. For example, we can now say, with the help of hindsight that a simple ""stress test,"" incorporating a sharp fall in asset prices, would have told us a rough image of what could develop with respect to the banks' capital position.

Financial infrastructure too needs a thorough review. Inadequate accounting system, which failed to reveal the ""true"" balance sheet conditions, made it difficult even for bank management to promptly grasp the reality. Modernized accounting standards, coupled with enhanced disclosure, should work as a disciplinary force to facilitate initiation and progress towards recognizing and addressing the problems.

Finally, I would note that the unique structure of Japan's corporate governance may have contributed to the delay in responding to the evolving situation. Main features of such governance -- the cross holding of shares between companies, oversight by ""main banks,"" and selection of directors from within, among others -- worked so well when growth was the norm; they appear to have failed to generate painful and yet necessary adjustment actions. Supervisory pressures, which should have supplemented the weak private governance mechanism, proved to be less than satisfactory due partly to the inadequate financial infrastructure cited above.

In this situation the banks were allowed to rest on ""wait and see"" attitude with an optimistic expectation that a recovery in the economy and asset markets would help them out of the problem. It has turned out that such forbearance merely aggravated the banks' problem and the economy.

What are the implications of these Japanese experiences to financial system reform more generally, as we enter the next millennium? Delivering the Ten Commandments to financial system stability is, as you imagine, beyond the scope of my presentation today. The financial world, unfortunately, changes too quickly for that. I will concentrate on a more specific aspect, the interactions between the authorities and market participants, including financial institutions, which had important influences over the developments in Japan.

The question that I am going to ask is: what changes should we envision in the division of labor between the authorities and market participants? I would like to offer my observations on what could and should change in that division of labor and what would not change.

Change would be most evident in the ability of the authorities to keep track, in a timely and accurate manner, of the risk profiles of individual market participants. Maybe as recently as a decade ago, supervisors and regulators were able to understand reasonably well the risk profiles of institutions under their jurisdiction by looking at the books of such institutions. With the advances in financial theory and information technology, now it has become possible to unbundle and repackage risks in a myriad of ways in a matter of hours if not minutes. This trend would probably accelerate. As a result, the checks and balances from market forces would become more important in the coming years. Strengthened corporate governance, from better decision making by management to more effective shareholder controls, is one element. Another would be discipline imposed by counterparties. Looking back, what prompted the changes in the behavior of Japanese financial institutions in the aftermath of the bubble were such uncompromising forces of the markets. Under these circumstances, there will likely be more and more instances where central banks and other authorities would defer to, and even encourage, the checks and balances imposed by the markets.

Let me turn to what would not change. Society needs someone to closely watch macro risk profiles, even when individual market participants carefully manage their own risks. This is the lesson we should all learn from recurrent bubbles since the Tulip Mania. The elements of the macro risk profile that need to be monitored would change over time. Sometimes, it could be the concurrent increase in real estate prices and bank credit. In a different place and time, it could be a flood of short-term capital inflows under pegged exchange rate regimes. Such incidents are rare indeed, but they repeatedly come back to haunt us and their repercussions are profound. Who is the most capable of fulfilling this monitoring role? There appears no better candidate than the central bank, which is often criticized for taking away the punch bowl at the party. Moreover, central banks have always been involved in maintaining overall financial stability. The form and nature of this important role would, of course, change as the global marketplace in financial services manifests itself. I will come back to the issue later in connection with the experiences of financial crises in the emerging markets.

The acute financial crisis that unfolded in Japan in late 1997 and continued through most of 1998 showed how a systemic problem could take a heavy toll on the economy. As the markets increasingly focused on banks' undercapitalized situation, liquidity of banks tended to dry up. The capital and liquidity shortage forced them to withdraw credit from their borrowers. Risk appetite sharply receded as undercapitalized banks lost the capacity to assume potential risks and as corporate borrowers were preoccupied with day-to-day liquidity. Without risk takers in the system, economic growth would be severely constrained. Such risk aversion in the aftermath of the burst of ""bubbles"" appears to have been one background to help explain the performance of Japan's economy in the 1990s. It is for this reason that a healthy financial system is a major condition for sound economic developments.

Financial markets in Japan have shown an impressive turnaround this year. Against the backdrop of major banks' recapitalization and the Bank of Japan's determination to hold down short-term interest rates to virtually zero, liquidity pressures have dissipated, the stock market has recovered some of the ground lost earlier, and interest rates have sharply dropped across the spectrum. These improvements are encouraging, and, contrary to last year, should work as a positive force to help make progress towards an eventual recovery.

Indeed, the downslide in overall activity has come to a halt. A modest upturn may emerge in the coming months. Inflation has also been stable at marginally negative rates. However, the recent stabilization is largely a product of policy mobilization in full dimension -- monetary ease, increased government outlays, tax cuts, and a financial safety net. Private spending shows little sign of responding to these stimuli yet.

It is important to point out in this context that Japan too has major ""structural"" problems. In terms of constraints on economic recovery, the following aspects appear to deserve special attention.

The first is the financial system, which needs to be substantially and boldly restructured. Experiences in Scandinavia and elsewhere suggest that it often takes a few years before recapitalized banks regain ability to function as healthy intermediaries. This may also hold for Japanese banks, as they would first have to clear up the balance sheets more thoroughly, cultivate more appropriate risk assessment methodologies, develop strategies to focus on where they believe competitive advantage lies, and grow far more efficient.

The second is the low productivity in the non-manufacturing sector relative to that in the manufacturing industry, although it is somewhat an oversimplification to lump together the wide spectrum of non-manufacturing industries. A better phrase to describe the industries in question may be segments of the economy which have not been fully exposed to global competition. Inefficiencies can partly be attributable to years of various regulations, which shielded the industries from competition. However, as globalization proceeds, the traditional distinction between tradable and non-tradable goods and services is becoming blurred every day. Some services, in particular financial and information services, are now tradable similar to cars, computers, VCRs, and what have you. As a result, the traditionally domestic non-manufacturing industries are now exposed to more and more competition, and have been forced to become more efficient. Based on such a recognition, Japan's deregulation focusing on non-manufacturing industries has made significant inroads since the early 90s. Of course, as the experiences of the U.S. and U.K. in the 70s and 80s show, it will take a considerable time before such efforts bear fruit.

The third is the growing imbalance between savings and investment from a relatively long-term perspective. Japan, like many other Asian countries, has enjoyed a high share of fixed investment to GDP, which is consistent with relatively high economic growth. However, with the aging population and decline of the labor growth rate to near zero, growth potential tends to become lower. Also, high investment in the past produced an unfavorable investment climate in which Japan's capital/labor ratio surpasses that of the U.S. and the rate of return on capital was extremely low. Cyclical development in the 90s augmented the downward adjustment of the capital spending ratio to GDP from 20% in 1991 to now about 13%.

On the other hand, contrary to what one might expect of an aging society, the savings rates has remained at a high level. It is always difficult to find plausible explanation for savings rates, but increased public anxiety over the future, including, in particular, the future of the pension system, is likely playing a role. Such savings-investment gap cannot be filled by macro-economic demand stimuli alone.

Against this background, we remain vigilant with the prospect of economic recovery on a sustained basis. Obviously, we are committed to make every effort to achieve sustainable growth and price stability -- neither inflation nor deflation. Now that macro-economic policies are fully mobilized, however, structural policies and adjustment should play a greater role to this end.

Important as Japan's resumption of growth is, the restoration of economic growth in Japan cannot necessarily be the magic bullet for East Asian economic recovery. When we look at the exports compositions of East Asian countries to Japan, the United States, the European Union, and other regions including intra trade and Latin American countries, the highest is intra trade excluding Japan, constituting 39% of the total trade during 1997. As for the rest, Japan constitutes about 12%, and the United States 20% of the total. In contrast, in the case of Mexico, its exports to the United States exceeded 80% of Mexico's total exports, which accounts for the ""V shaped"" exports-led recovery of Mexico after the currency crisis from the end of 1994 through 1995. Given this difference in trade relationship between Japan and East Asian countries vis-a-vis the United States and Mexico, Japan's recovery does not guarantee an automatic recovery of East Asian economies. Economic recovery in Asia is ultimately up to the efforts of individual countries in the region, including Japan.

In the last part of my presentation today, I would like to turn to the various efforts now underway in the international arena to address financial fragility, primarily the efforts I am involved in at the Committee on the Global Financial System, and how these discussions are relevant to economies and markets in Asia.

Whether we like it or not, financial crises grab the attention of everyone -- politicians, ministries and agencies, central bankers, market participants, and the public at large -- and raise their awareness of the importance of the smooth functioning of financial markets. As the initial shock waves recede and relative calm returns to the markets, discussions inevitably begin to draw lessons and to make the necessary improvements to the financial system. The Asian financial crisis was no exception. We have already seen a wealth of material from both the private and public sectors on its causes, the appropriateness of policy responses, and even proposals for an overhaul of the international monetary system. My task today, however, is not to give you an overview of these discussions. I will rather explain to you what the Committee on the Global Financial System and other international groupings have achieved so far and what we are aiming for in the near future.

The Committee on the Global Financial System, formerly known as the Euro-currency Standing Committee, is one of the Basle-based committees of the G10 central banks. We have invited representatives from emerging market economies, including those from the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, who have made valuable contributions. Its shorthand ""CGFS"" has not as yet gained wide recognition. The Committee is entrusted with the regular monitoring of international financial markets for the central bank community, with examining how financial markets work, and with developing appropriate recommendations designed to improve the functioning of markets. As this explanation of the role of the Committee clearly suggests, studies of the Asian financial crisis from the perspective of market functioning and discussions on desirable improvements to the international financial infrastructure have been at the center of the Committee's agenda.

The Asian financial crisis was partially a result of considerable excesses in the region's economies. I will not attempt to explain the root causes of such excesses, but would like to note that nobody forced the over-building, over-investment, or over-consumption that paved the road for the crisis. Unfortunately, excess is a fact of life in a market based economy and human beings. Excesses also contributed to the current problems of the Japanese economy, which I described earlier.

Just because excesses are ingrained into the system, however, it does not follow that we have to be at their mercy. Broadly speaking, there are two possible courses of action. One is to constrain directly the behavior of market participants through a system of prohibitions, regulations and controls. The other course is to improve the market's infrastructure so as to improve their functioning, thereby reinforcing the self-correcting forces of markets and lessening the likelihood of excess. Controls on short-term capital flows is an example of the former and enhancing market transparency is an example of the latter.

Generally speaking, central bankers are skeptical of the effectiveness of direct controls. While possibly effective as a short-term emergency measure to counter overshooting in times of stress, in the long run, direct controls are costly to administer and create distortions in the allocation of capital and risk-taking that are difficult to correct. This is why the Committee on the Global Financial System has stepped up its efforts to formulate recommendations for improving market functioning in the global context. The Committee has, in particular, concentrated on the issue of market transparency, because the availability of comprehensive, meaningful and accurate information is a necessary precondition for effective decision making and self-discipline by market participants.

One of the first results the Committee generated in this area involved enhancing the transparency of foreign exchange reserves and drains, as outlined in a report published in the autumn of last year. The recommendations, which were recently incorporated into the Special Data Dissemination Standards by the International Monetary Fund, reflected our thinking that more comprehensive, detailed and timely information on the foreign currency liquidity position of the public sector could improve the accountability of the authorities and the scope for markets to exercise financial discipline. This, in turn, could help induce an earlier correction of unsustainable policies and allow market participants to form a more accurate view of the condition of individual countries, thereby also possibly limiting contagion.

In that report, it was likewise noted that an effective market discipline mechanism could also require an appropriate framework for disclosure and reporting by private sector entities. Against this background, work is now underway from two angles: enhancing public disclosure by individual institutions, and identifying possible gaps in aggregate information available to market participants. As to disclosure, every market participant should provide sufficient information about its activities to the market so as to enable accurate and effective assessment of risks -- for example, market risk, credit risk, liquidity risk, etc. Meanwhile, the availability of sufficient aggregate information could contribute to the better evaluation of overall market conditions. While we have not published reports so far, I can assure you that considerable progress has been made and that the first results should become visible before long.

As a final point concerning the work of the Committee on the Global Financial System, I would also like to refer to its work aimed at furthering our understanding of the mechanics of modern international financial markets, especially market liquidity. This March, the Committee published a report describing the mechanics of repo markets and their growing importance in both private market participants and central banks. In addition, in April it released a report on the determinants of market liquidity and on possible steps that might be taken in order to establish liquid markets. This report is a significant first step -- it provides insight into market liquidity, which, while quite elusive, plays an important role in the unfolding of systemic financial crises.

These efforts by the Committee on the Global Financial System are, of course, not conducted in a vacuum. They are part of a broader set of initiatives by the international financial community to address financial fragility. An important development in this context has been the recent establishment of the Financial Stability Forum, composed for the time being of G7 central banks, ministries, and regulators, as well as key international groupings. This Forum should not be seen as becoming a super regulator. Rather, by assembling selected members of the public sector, it should contribute to enhancing cooperation among various bodies and ensuring a more effective allocation of human resources in the pursuit of financial stability. At its first meeting last month, the Forum decided to address issues pertaining to highly leveraged institutions, offshore centers, and short-term capital flows, all of which have obvious connections with our experiences during the Asian financial crisis. While it is too early to predict any outcome, the reality of modern international financial markets -- global integration, and continuing advances in financial and information technology -- would call for a heavy focus on efforts to structure incentives of market participants towards the goal of financial stability through enhanced transparency and better use of information.

Finally, I would like to offer a few thoughts on the implications of these international efforts for the economies and markets in Asia.

Just a few minutes ago, I have already noted the tendency of central banks to prefer market-based solutions. Having said this, I am, at the same time, not fully comfortable to concur with prominent hedge fund managers who maintain that hedge funds provide valuable services by correcting policy mistakes at an early stage. Meanwhile I cannot dismiss the view that international financial flows have become so large that they have the potential, because of their sheer size, to overwhelm smaller economies even without major policy mistakes. There might be a genuine problem if self-fulfilling expectations of market participants could dislocate an economy from a ""good equilibrium"" to a ""bad equilibrium"" in a multiple equilibria situation, if I may borrow some words from game theory.

Nevertheless, on balance, I would say I am optimistic as regards the role played by markets. In the case of Asia, it must be stressed that the remarkable growth before the crisis and relatively high level of per capita income widely observed today in the region were made possible by the entrepreneurship of the people and market-based policies adopted by the governments in the region. The market is like a pendulum. It oscillates from one side to another, and shocks can occasionally swing it widely off center. Eventually, however, it will return to the center, i.e., to the equilibrium reflecting collective wisdom of market forces.

Our strategy, therefore, should be to put the market first, but, at the same time, to carefully monitor developments and to take necessary steps to correct any market failures that may manifest themselves. This means that a long-term perspective on risks in the market and a thorough understanding of market participants' incentives are necessary. In this process, debate and interactions between the private and public sectors are desirable.

International fora should have a role in this context as monitoring vehicles and clearing houses for ideas and observations. For this purpose, the active involvement of emerging market economies, which the Committee on the Global Financial System and other Basle-based committees have sought in recent years, is very important.

Thank you for your kind attention.",,Positive,0.6689805388,,
"Jun. 22, 1999","Speech given by Masaru Hayami, Governor of the Bank of Japan, at the Japan National Press Club in Tokyo on June 22, 1999 (On Recent Monetary Policy)","Introduction
Four months have passed since February when the Bank of Japan launched its so-called zero interest rate policy, and my speech today explains our thinking behind this historically unprecedented policy.

At the outset, it should be pointed out that all decisions regarding the Bank's policies, including the present zero interest rate policy, are made after deep and wide-ranging discussions by the Policy Board. For example, as can be seen in the recent minutes of Monetary Policy Meetings, when the Policy Board decided upon a zero interest rate policy, it gave serious consideration to such policy alternatives as quantitative monetary easing and inflation targeting. For details of these discussions, the minutes of Monetary Policy Meetings are available.

II. Zero Interest Rate Policy
A. Elements of the Zero Interest Rate Policy
The so-called zero interest rate policy comprises three elements. First, to encourage the unsecured overnight call rate to move as low as possible by providing ample funds. Second, to pay due consideration to maintaining the proper functioning of the market so as to avoid disturbance in the short-term money market. And third, to continue with the current policy until deflationary concerns subside.

Of these three, the first element is a specific directive to guide the interest rate down to around zero. Like the central bank in the US and elsewhere, daily monetary control in Japan is conducted through guiding the shortest inter-bank rate, namely the unsecured overnight call rate. Up to last February when the Bank decided on the zero interest rate policy, the target for guiding the unsecured overnight call rate had already been as low as 0.25 percent, which had left hardly any room for further reduction. Under such circumstances, a view was expressed at the Monetary Policy Meeting on February 12 that for further monetary easing quantitative targeting might be more effective. The majority view, however, was that the demand for monetary base fluctuated widely depending on money market developments and that its relationship with the real economy was not stable. After thorough discussion, it was decided to make the maximum use of the remaining room for the further reduction of interest rates by eliminating the de facto floor for the call rate. Interest rates and the quantity of money are two sides of the same coin. A reduction of interest rates to zero accompanies simultaneous quantitative easing on a massive scale, which expressed by the phrase ""provide ample liquidity.""

The second policy element is to pay due consideration to maintaining the proper functioning of the market. This means the careful and cautious guidance of interest rates while keeping a close watch on the behavior of market participants and the functioning of the market after the lower limit for the call rate has been removed. Since the call market is an important market where all transactions in Japan are finally settled, the central bank should at all cost avoid any disruption. In guiding interest rates down to zero the Bank was navigating uncharted waters and hence in the process had to pay particular attention to the effects of the policy change. Since the decision on February 12, the Bank gradually and cautiously encouraged the fall in the call rate while carefully monitoring market developments. By April the unsecured overnight call rate had declined to 0.03 percent and has remained stable since then. This call rate of 0.03 percent can be regarded as the de facto zero interest rate taking into consideration transaction fees.

A conspicuous change in the market structure during this period was the downsizing of the call market from 35 trillion yen to 20 trillion yen, or a decline of approximately 40 percent. The downsizing itself is a result of the large decline in the need for fund-raising in the call market and, in a sense, is a natural reaction of the market mechanism to the ample provision of funds. The question is whether such downsizing has made transactions in the market less smooth. So far we have not observed any problems, but we will maintain a close watch on the impact of our zero interest rate policy on the market function.

With respect to the third policy element that the Bank will continue with the current policy until deflationary concerns subside, this is not in the February 12 decision, but is an expression of the current stance of the Bank's monetary policy based on the majority opinion of the Policy Board. Needless to say, the objective of monetary policy is to contribute to the sound development of the national economy through the pursuit of price stability. In other words, the Bank aims at achieving a situation which is neither deflationary nor inflationary. Therefore, as long as deflationary concerns linger, the Bank should continue with its current monetary easing to achieve price stability and economic recovery. In making clear its stance, the Bank sought to explain to the market, as well as to the public, the objective of its monetary policy in the context of current economic conditions so as to maintain the credibility of monetary policy. Particularly in view of the instability in the financial market that we have experienced from time to time since last year, we thought it necessary to restate the objective of monetary policy to secure market stability. In fact, since I referred to this objective in April, the downward trend has permeated from shorter to longer term interest rates.

B. Effects of the Zero Interest Rate Policy
Since April, the unsecured overnight call rate, the direct target of the Bank's monetary policy operations, has remained stable at around 0.03 percent, or virtually at zero percent. Interest rates on longer terms have also declined sharply in the short-term money market. As a result, a sense of relief regarding fund availability has spread among financial institutions. Also, concern overseas about the availability of funds to Japanese banks has receded significantly, the effect of which has manifested itself in the almost complete disappearance of the Japan premium since March. The permeation of monetary easing seems to have induced liquidity to flow into longer term debt and equities, having a favorable effect on long-term interest rates and stock prices.

Against this background, tightness in corporate funding has eased considerably. Last year, the turmoil in international financial markets and the failure of several Japanese financial institutions impaired the proper functioning of domestic financial markets, making it difficult for even blue-chip companies to raise funds in the market. Financial institutions were obliged to assume a strict attitude toward lending because of not only the constraint on their capital position but also difficulties in their fund raising. All this has changed considerably since early spring, and we can now safely say that the financial environment as a whole has improved significantly.

It appears that the zero interest rate policy has begun to exert a beneficial influence on strengthening the forces for economic recovery from the monetary side. What are the reasons for this? Simply stated, the monetary easing in February was to reduce the targeted call rate by some 0.25 percent, which was the same as the policy change on September 9 last year in terms of the size of reduction in the call rate. Nevertheless, the effects seem to have perhaps been much larger than generally expected.

One of the reasons for the larger than expected effects is that the zero interest rate policy benefited from the synergy of such favorable factors as an improvement in the international environment surrounding Japan. Last summer, the economic crisis in Russia and the collapse of a major hedge fund in the US triggered considerable tension in international capital markets. The increase in the Japan premium was caused not only by domestic factors but also by such international factors. Fortunately, the tension in international financial markets began to lessen from around the end of last year. On the domestic front, measures to restore Japan's financial system, such as the injection of capital using public funds and the introduction of a special credit guarantee system for small and medium-sized firms substantially contributed to easing tightness in the financial market and corporate funding. In addition to the favorable turn of events, a strong resolve expressed by the Bank to avoid deflation by implementing the zero interest rate policy was a significant contributing factor.

The zero interest rate policy not only had such an effect but also helped to revive, to some extent, the weakened financial intermediation function in Japan as observed last year.

To elucidate the point, let me first describe a 'liquidity effect' of the zero interest rate policy. Whatever the level may be, a reduction in interest rates requires a corresponding increase in liquidity. Reducing the interest rate down to zero means that the central bank will provide enough liquidity so that all the demand for short-term funds will be met in the market. Under such circumstances, the market will reach a stage where there is hardly any liquidity risk for market participants. As was mentioned previously, concern about liquidity increased substantially in Japan's financial markets last year. The zero interest rate policy played a significant role in completely turning around the situation which could be labeled 'liquidity evaporation.'

The zero interest rate policy also had the effect of encouraging risk taking by market participants. Whether indirect financing like bank lending or direct financing, the essence of financial intermediation lies in taking future risks. When financial institutions become excessively cautious as was the case last year, they will not take even normal risks and the financial intermediation function to support economic activity weakens considerably. As a consequence of the latest decline in interest rates, institutional investors have gradually become more active in investing in securities with longer maturities or those carrying some credit risk such as CP and corporate bonds. Of course, excesses must be avoided and we intend to carefully monitor market developments. In contrast, as regards bank lending, we cannot yet say that a recovery has been seen. Needless to say, we also intend to closely monitor any changes in the attitude of banks toward lending and how such changes might affect corporate funding and investment behavior.

III. Discussions on Zero Interest Rate Policy
A. Zero Interest Rate Policy and Quantitative Easing
We recognize there are opinions that it is not enough just to continue the current policy and that the Bank of Japan should pursue quantitative easing or inflation targeting, or increase the purchase of government bonds to prevent a rise in long-term interest rates.

Regarding quantitative easing, it should be noted that both a reduction in interest rates and quantitative easing are expressions of monetary easing, only from a different point of view. One cannot increase quantity while keeping interest rates constant, and conversely, one cannot reduce interest rates while keeping quantity constant. Interest rates and the quantity of money should be treated as inseparable.

The zero interest rate policy is to encourage the unsecured overnight call rate to move as low as possible by providing ample funds. In this sense, the Bank has already effected sufficient quantitative easing because interest rates have declined to virtually zero.

For example, at present the required reserves for financial institutions amount to some 4 trillion yen per day, but the Bank has been providing more liquidity than the required amount. Recently, we offered to supply funds to the market through our daily operations, but there was not enough demand. The Bank tried to provide additional liquidity, but the market responded ""enough."" This evidences, in our view, the abundance of liquidity in the market.

Another example. For the past three years, money supply has increased by 60 trillion yen, which is more than ten times the 5 trillion yen increase in nominal GDP. As a result, the ratio of money supply to nominal GDP, Marshallian k, which shows how much money is circulating compared with economic activity, has rapidly risen. The pace of rise matches or exceeds that experienced in the high inflation period of excess liquidity in the 1970s and the bubble period of the 1980s.

As such, current monetary policy has already had a significant easing effect from the quantitative aspect. When quantitative easing is discussed, it sometimes specifically refers to measures which set some numerical targets for quantitative indicators such as money supply. Since interest rates and the quantity of money are two sides of the same coin, the argument can be rephrased as the following technical question: ""For monetary easing, is it better to focus mainly on the quantity of money or interest rates as an operational target?""

For example, in an economy where inflationary expectations fluctuate significantly due to such external shocks as an oil crisis, nominal and real interest rates diverge. Thus, focusing only on interest rates runs the risk of making a mistake regarding the degree of monetary easing and tightening. Under such circumstances, it is better to conduct monetary operations guided by quantitative targets such as money supply.

Conversely, in an economy where demand for money greatly fluctuates, setting a quantitative target becomes rather dangerous. Until the latter half of last year, the monetary base, which is the sum of currency in circulation and reserve deposits, had exhibited a high growth rate of about 10 percent on a year-on-year basis. This was because, against the background of anxiety regarding financial system instability, the financial, household, and corporate sectors held a huge amount of liquidity either in the form of cash or deposits with the Bank of Japan. If the Bank had adopted quantitative targeting under such a situation, it would have meant a tightening of monetary policy which would have been contrary to its policy stance.

There are many other issues to be examined such as the relationship between quantitative indicators and the real economy, the Bank's controllability of such indicators, and the effect of targeting on financial system stability. These issues have been taken up for active discussion by the Policy Board. One Board member even made a specific proposal for quantitative targeting. However, the majority opinion of the Policy Board to date is that it is more appropriate to effect monetary easing by using interest rates as an operational target rather than setting quantitative targets.

B. Zero Interest Rate Policy and Inflation Targeting
The Bank of Japan Law explicitly stipulates that monetary policy aims at price stability. Hence from the viewpoint of pursuing price stability, there would be no conflict between our current conduct of monetary policy and inflation targeting. The difference boils down to whether or not to set a specific numerical target such as a 1 percent increase in CPI.

Since the central bank aims at price stability over the medium to long term, it needs to make a manifold analysis of various factors affecting price developments, such as the risk of future price changes, to come to a judgment. It is dangerous to stick to a specific figure for a specific price indicator as a target. For example, even if a specific target were set, it does not necessarily follow that a policy response would not be required until the actual price index exceeded the target. Depending on the speed of price changes and tightness of supply and demand conditions, there might be a situation where an appropriate policy response would be called for before the price index reached the target.

The currently prevailing argument for inflation targeting includes dissipating the current excessive deflationary expectations of the public by raising their inflationary expectations. Can we really raise inflationary expectations just by announcing an inflation target? Even if we can, there is the danger that long-term interest rates may rise to the point where they have an adverse impact on the economy.

What is the significance of setting numerical targets, be it money supply or inflation, for monetary policy? The answer is to prevent market participants from engaging in unnecessary speculation by clearly showing the Bank's commitment to its policy objective.

If so, without entering the tricky area of setting specific and concrete targets, the Bank can incorporate the usefulness embodied in inflation targeting by making explicit the key elements of monetary policy conduct. It was this line of thinking that was behind the Bank's explicit announcement that it would ""continue with the current policy until deflationary concerns subside.""

C. Underwriting and the Outright Purchase of Government Bonds by the Bank
Behind the request that the Bank underwrite government bonds, there seems to be the intention that the Bank, through underwriting, should ensure the smooth issuance of government bonds, thereby containing a rise in long-term interest rates. If this is the case, then the Bank holds firm against complying with such a request.

Once a central bank engages in the automatic financing of a fiscal deficit, sooner or later the time will come when it cannot put a brake on money expansion, thereby inducing vicious inflation. This is one valuable lesson that we have learned from history and constitutes the main reason why the underwriting of long-term government bonds is prohibited not only in Japan but also in other industrialized countries.

An increase in the outright purchase of long-term government bonds eventually leads to the same situation as in underwriting. Over time, long-term interest rates are determined reflecting the views of market participants on the future state of the economy and prices. If the Bank were to prevent long-term interest rates from rising despite market pressures, it would have no choice but to increase the purchase of government bonds. Then, inflationary expectations would intensify, putting further pressures on long-term interest rates. Such a vicious circle would repeat itself and the amount of government bonds that had to be purchased would increase infinitely. This would eventually be the same as the underwriting of government bonds.

If a limit on either the amount or the period is set for the underwriting or the outright purchase of government bonds, can we obtain favorable results while avoiding the vicious circle?

The answer is ""no"" if we consider the mechanism of financial markets and the behavior of market participants. Even if the amount or the period is limited, market participants will always think about what is ahead when they act. It is natural for investors who want to purchase ten-year government bonds to think about ten years ahead. Therefore, once market participants anticipate a rise in long-term interest rates after the pre-determined underwriting or outright purchase is completed, long-term interest rates will in fact rise immediately, not in the distant future. Furthermore, if market participants perceive that a brake has been released in seeing the central bank begin monetizing the fiscal deficit by even a limited amount, there is a risk that the market would become concerned with vicious inflation and loss of fiscal discipline. Given that globalization will continue and that investors worldwide are interested in Japanese government bonds for portfolio management purposes, we should be very careful about our policy operations, while keeping in mind such a market response.

The issue will come to be a matter of confidence in the yen and the Bank's conduct of monetary policy, and eventually confidence in the Japanese economy itself. Confidence would most likely be eroded if the Bank succumbed to the request for the underwriting or increase in the outright purchase of government bonds, with or without a limit on the amount or the period.

Let me turn to the difference between the outright purchase of long-term government bonds currently conducted by the Bank and the recent request to underwrite or increase the outright purchase of government bonds. Our current long-term government bond purchase operations are a way to smoothly provide the long-term funds necessary for sustainable growth of the economy. They are neither aimed at the smooth issuance of government bonds nor for supporting their prices. The Bank makes it a rule to purchase long-term government bonds in the amount roughly consistent with the trend growth rate of banknote issuance over the medium term. By adopting such a rule, the Bank tries not to directly affect long-term interest rates. The Bank will continue to hold firm to the posture that it will not purchase long-term government bonds for smooth issuance or price maintenance purposes.

Relating to this discussion, there are suggestions that the Bank should effect quantitative easing through the purchase of government bonds. In response to these suggestions, monetary easing has already permeated the market and the Bank has sufficient operational tools to effect monetary easing. The Bank does not have to resort to an increase in the purchase of government bonds in the conduct of its current monetary policy.

Since the Bank is providing ample liquidity to the market, related anxiety has almost disappeared in financial markets. However, many investors and financial institutions seem to be experiencing a hard time finding good borrowers and profitable investments. For the whole economy the savings and investment balance is tilted toward huge net savings.

Under such circumstances, if the yield on government bonds records a large increase over a sustained period, it will most likely signal either that views on the economy are turning favorable or that the market is warning against an increase in the budget deficit. In the case of the former, it indicates economic recovery and we welcome this development while staying alert to whether there is any overreaction in the market. In the case of the latter, we should use it as an opportunity to review the costs and benefits regarding the widening of the budget deficit in the context of future economic developments.

D. Reforming the Government Bond Market
Even if the Bank does not underwrite or increase the purchase of government bonds, it does not mean that the government bond market is not important. In fact, the government bond market has become increasingly important. The Bank has long been working actively on the issue of reforming the Japanese government bond market, and it will continue to make the utmost efforts toward that end.

For the Bank, the government bond market is an important market in which its operations, such as repos and short-term government bond operations, are conducted. In addition, the Bank conducts various businesses from the issuance to the redemption of government bonds on behalf of the government, not to mention running the government bond settlement system. From such a standpoint, we have taken a great interest and devoted much effort in improving the functions of the government bond market. In preparation for the introduction of real time gross settlement by the end of 2000, the Bank has been working hard on upgrading computer systems, and, at the same time, formulating new market practices together with market participants.

In general, financial assets with low liquidity which are traded by a small number of investors in the market tend to show excess price volatility. Therefore, making the government bond market more liquid and convenient for many diversified investors is essential to improve functions of both the primary and secondary markets. The importance of reforming the government bond market does not stop here. A highly liquid government bond market in which the market mechanism functions efficiently forms a basis for developing other financial markets. In this regard, we should not underwrite government bonds and contain their prices against market pressures. Rather, we think it important, through improving the functioning of the government bond market, to strengthen financial markets which are the basic infrastructure of our national economy.

We expect that the issues regarding fiscal management and the government bond market will continue to be discussed in various fora, including the Diet. The Bank stands ready to make a contribution by, for example, stating its views.

IV. Current Situation and Prospects for the Japanese Economy
A. Current Situation
While the Japanese economy has stopped deteriorating, there are not yet clear signs of a recovery. There are four reasons behind the halt in deterioration and which can be summarized as follows:

First, an increase in policy-driven demand such as public investment and housing investment has been observed.

Second, under the continued expansion of the US economy, the economic environment overseas has been improving as a whole as illustrated by the gradual recovery of Asian economies and the rebound of international commodity prices.

Third, as a result of such developments in final demand together with the cautious attitude of firms toward production, inventory adjustment has progressed. Judging from current inventories, it appears that conditions are being laid for production to increase once final demand picks up.

Fourth, against the background of our zero interest rate policy and the injection of capital into major banks using public funds, the financial environment has turned favorable.

B. Prospects
Though the Japanese economy has stopped deteriorating, we cannot yet foresee an autonomous recovery. There are three reasons for this.

The first is that the present halt in the deterioration of the economy is basically supported by policy-driven demand like public investment, and private demand, which is the engine for an autonomous recovery, still remains weak. Considering that future demand prospects are uncertain and that balance sheet adjustment is needed to improve soundness and efficiency, particularly among large firms, business fixed investment will very likely further decline in fiscal 1999. In view of the increasing severity of the employment and income environment reflecting aggressive corporate restructuring, it seems difficult to expect any rapid recovery of private consumption from the current situation.

The second reason is that we still need time to carefully monitor how an improvement in the financial environment affects the real economy. It is true that the attitude of financial institutions toward lending has become less strict compared with a while ago, but their balance sheet adjustments and strengthening of risk management systems have not yet reached a stage where they will actively seek loans that carry larger credit risk. Stock prices have been partly supported by such outside factors as rising US stock prices. To ensure the continued improvement of the financial environment and subsequently of the real economy which leads to a virtuous circle between finance and the economy, it is necessary for firms to restructure themselves in a forward-looking manner and to consolidate their business in such a way that will gain the confidence of the market.

The third reason, which relates to the weakness of private demand pointed out earlier, is the persisting pressure of structural adjustment. Needless to say, changes in industrial structure are inevitable for the Japanese economy to become more efficient. Among these changes, employment is one of the most serious problems during the transitional period. In this regard, we welcome the government's initiative to create an employment policy framework which is consistent with the direction of structural reform. Nevertheless, it should be noted that, at least for a short period, there is a possibility of increased downward pressure on the economy from the employment side.

Bearing these reasons in mind, the present situation does not warrant an autonomous recovery of the economy led by private demand in the latter half of this fiscal year when public investment is expected to taper off. Thus, potential downward pressure on prices appears to remain, and it is our judgment that the economy has not yet reached the stage where deflationary concerns have been dispelled.

V. Conclusion
At the present moment, with prolonged worries regarding financial system stability at last subsiding, the Japanese economy stands at an important crossroads. If it can overcome such problems as the changes in industrial structure and unemployment, then an autonomous recovery can be realized. In this regard, we are well aware that monetary policy plays an important role. Based on such recognition, the Bank has committed itself to maintaining its monetary easing policy until deflationary worries subside.

Needless to say, monetary policy alone cannot solve all problems. We should thoroughly recognize that the current zero interest rate policy is an unusual and emergency measure for a central bank and also that we should not indefinitely pursue an expansionary fiscal policy centering on public investment. To truly revitalize the Japanese economy we must forcefully promote structural reform to strengthen the supply side, while sustaining the economy through an aggregate demand policy.

There are various aspects to structural reform, the main purpose of which is to garner the intrinsic potential power of the economy and to raise the medium-term expected growth rate. To these ends, competitive dynamism should be fully utilized. It is thus necessary to create a competitive market environment which encourages firms to boldly pursue technological innovation and explore new business areas. In addition, to take advantage of new investment opportunities, it is essential to have efficient and well-functioning financial markets which enable savings to be smoothly channeled to investment through various financial instruments.

If the changes in industrial structure and reform of the financial system progress and public expectations for growth become more optimistic, our monetary easing policy to date will become even more effective.",,Positive,0.8440488577,,
"Jul. 1, 1999","Speech by Kazuo Ueda, Member of the Policy Board of the Bank of Japan, at the Meeting on Economic and Financial Matters in Kagoshima, on July 1, 1999 (The Bank of Japan's Forward Looking Approach)","Today I would like to discuss recent developments in the Bank of Japan's monetary policy by focusing on its forward looking aspects. It sounds obvious that a central bank ought to be looking far out into the future in setting current monetary policy. This is, however, easier said than done. Moreover, attempts to be forward looking constrain many aspects of monetary policy making.

1. Given my academic background, in everyday policy discussions I have tried to assess the usefulness of various schools of economic thought for actual policy decisions since I took the current position in April last year. One provisional answer I have obtained is the following: the single most important claim of the monetarism, i.e., to keep the growth rate of the money supply constant is hardly acceptable. On the other hand, the reasoning that supports such a conclusion seems to merit tremendous respect. Among others, long and variable lags in the effects of monetary policy are a key component of the monetarist thinking and should also attract the attention of policy makers.

2. A brief review of the recent Japanese experience about the relationship between monetary aggregates and the economy is provided. Long and variable lags in the effects of monetary policy are easy to see in the data. Thus, the BOJ cut the discount rate five consecutive times starting in January 1986 with the economy bottoming out 10 months later. Monetary tightening started in the spring of 1989. It took about a year for assets prices, and about two years for the economy to start declining. Similarly, the easing starting in July 1991 had to wait until October 1993 before exerting a strong impact on the economy.

Long and variable lags led monetarists to recommend constant money growth policy as a way to avoid creating unnecessary instability from the policy side. This proposition does not seem to stand up to the recent Japanese experience. The growth rate of M2+CD remained very stable between 3.0-4.0% since sometime in 1994. Yet real GDP growth fluctuated between -2.8% and 5.1%. Even the claim that high growth in monetary aggregates delivers strong real growth seems not to hold. In addition to the fairly high growth rates of M2+CD, the monetary base expanded at more than 7% for about 3 to 4 years until the fall of last year. Despite this last year saw the most serious recession since 1950.

The reason for the failure of the monetarist propositions is well known. Unstable money demand breaks the link between monetary aggregates and the real economy or inflation. In addition to the creation of many new financial products, unstable movements in the precautionary demand for money triggered by fear for financial system stability have been the major reason for the instability of money demand in Japan over the last few years.

Consequently, stable money supply does not mean stable monetary policy. This is why most central banks today use interest rates rather than monetary aggregates as instruments of policy. Moreover, the majority view is to move the instrument rather than holding it fixed, in order to achieve the goal of price stability. In using the instrument one needs to pay attention to the existence of the lag in policy effects. Hence, the importance of being forward looking.

3. The BOJ's monetary policy board made two important decisions this year. First, on the 12th of February the board decided to decrease the overnight call rate down to the lowest possible rate. (Henceforth, the zero interest rate policy.) The minutes of the meeting indicate this was a forward looking decision. Many members realized that ""the economy has stopped declining, but going forward, significant downside risks remain.""

Second, board members reached an agreement on April 9th as reflected in Governor Hayami's statement on April 13th that ""the zero interest rate policy will be maintained until deflationary concerns are over."" At the time, we were keen on maximizing the impact of the zero rate policy by making clear that the policy would remain unchanged for quite some time.

4. The above decisions have exerted critical impacts on money and financial markets. Put simply, many risk premiums and hence interest rates have declined sharply. Assets prices have risen. The effects are most salient in the term markets, the long-term government bonds market and the stock market. Even the notorious Japan premium has almost disappeared. The explanation for such developments is straightforward. The zero interest rate policy has forced investors to accept more risks.

5. We are now waiting for the rise in the assets prices to start stimulating the demand for goods and services. It is only five months from February. The claim for further easing at this stage that we hear from some circles seems unjustifiable given that the effects of the policy on the real side of the economy are yet to manifest themselves so far.

6. Going more specifically into the call for further easing, we realize that such requests are often based on serious misunderstandings on the current stance of the BOJ's policy. Many such claims involve recommendations for using monetary aggregates as either instruments or intermediate targets of monetary policy.

Before criticizing such recommendations, I would like to comment on the current operations of the BOJ. At a daily level, we carry out operations, mostly during the morning, in order to inject enough reserves consistent with the target for the call market rate. However, the relationship between the two, reserves and the call rate, is a very unstable one and changes from time to time according to the market's perception about the rate to prevail in the near future. Apart from the role reserves play in guiding the call rate to the target at a daily level, we do not have any targets for reserves or the monetary base. In fact, existence of such targets would be inconsistent with our target for the call rate. Of course, the growth rate of the monetary base has increased from around 3% earlier this year to around 7%. This is, however, not because we are targeting money growth, but because the zero rate policy has increased the demand for the monetary base. The growth in the base may slow down again in the near future due to further subsidence of fears for financial system instability or to the expected slowdown in summer-time bonus payments. But this would in no way be due to a change in the stance of our policy.

In contrast, the policy to target the growth rate of the money supply would, for example, set a target of 10% growth in the monetary base. Even such a policy normally operates through interest rates. How would it differ from a policy to cut the call rate? A once and for all cut in the call rate will not create additional stimulus until the rate is cut again by a policy decision. The policy to increase the money supply would first create some decline in the call rate, but automatically create further rate declines if the economy worsens and the demand for money declines. In this sense the commitment to avoid deflationary forces is stronger with money supply targeting.

If properly interpreted, the current policy stance involves the same degree of commitment to easy policy as does money supply targeting, but by using different semantics. We have lowered the call rate to the minimum and promised to keep it there until the economy is back on track. This means that we have promised to do everything using interest rates. To the extent that the money supply works through interest rates, the commitment money supply targeting delivers is already contained in the current policy stance. Put differently, our stance is close to the one advocated by Paul Krugman. He argues in one of his recent articles that to achieve his recommendations, all one needs is to promise not to raise rates even if the economy starts to recover so long as the recovery is weak. The major difference, of course, lies in the implicit inflation target. Whilst Krugman presumably has a target like 5% in mind, we do not have the intention to keep the zero rate until that point.

Consequently, shifting to an explicit money targeting policy from here would not create much value added in terms of further easing. To believe in strong additional effects of such a policy shift, one needs to believe that an increase in the money supply creates a stimulus without working through interest rates. Large amounts of excess reserves currently exist in the banking system. Not a single bank has said that a further increase in the reserves would increase their lendings. One might argue that money may affect other asset prices such as the exchange rate. But even here the mechanism is normally through interest rates. Apart from it, exchange rates may move in response to our attempts to directly buy foreign currencies or to inflation expectations. But the latter runs into a circular argument unless one can show there is a mechanism to create inflation. The former does not require an increase in the money supply.

The argument that an increase in the growth rate of the money supply increases inflationary expectations and stimulates aggregate demand by lowering real interest rates sounds attractive. It is unclear again, however, how this mechanism works when the nominal interest rate has been already driven down to zero.

One could still say that if the current stance and the money supply target produce the same result, why not the latter? The major counter-argument to this would be the difficulty of setting appropriate money growth targets. As pointed out at the beginning, the demand for the monetary base has been extremely unstable due to movements in people's psychology toward the soundness of the financial system. Year over year growth rate of the base has fluctuated between 3% and 10% over the last ten months or so.

How about a policy of letting the monetary base grow at 20 or 30% then? Inflation does not seem to be on the horizon. One can tighten after the inflation rate reaches 1 or 2%. We think such a policy would have a small chance of success for reasons already mentioned. When it does succeed, it will probably generate a much higher rate of inflation than 1 or 2%. Because of lags in the effects of policy, the 20-30% money growth will continue to generate inflationary pressure even after the tightening starts.

7. The similarity of the current stance to inflation targeting is easier to see. Some have criticized, however, that the current BOJ's policy stance is too non-transparent. According to them, the expression that ""we keep the zero rate policy until deflationary concerns are over"" does not make clear when the policy will be lifted. We think that at least partially the criticism is based on misunderstandings about the workings of monetary policy.

The intent of the policy stance would be clearer under a directive to ""keep the zero rate policy until the CPI inflation rate reaches x%."" It should at once be apparent, however, that such a policy stance cannot be adopted. Given lags in the effects of monetary policy, the directive ought to read like "" we will stick to the zero rate policy until the expected CPI inflation rate one or two years from now reaches x%."" The expectation of future inflation rates for the policy decision is formed by the central bank. It would be almost impossible to come up with a simple relationship between observable variables and the expected inflation rate formed by the central bank. Hence, even the approach that makes clear the inflation target necessarily involves some discretion to say the least. I gather that most of the inflation targeting approaches currently adopted by other central banks fall into such a category.

I hasten to add that many important price indexes such as CPI, WPI, GDP deflator and CSPI have been showing divergent trends in Japan. Hence, we have been reluctant to use a particular price index as the variable on which to set a target of policy.

The expression to ""keep the zero rate until deflationary concerns are over"" reflects our determination to be forward looking. We do not want to respond to short-run fluctuations in the economy. Rather, our intention is to keep the zero rate policy until we are sure that serious downside risks are over when we look ahead a period like half a year to two years. Our judgement on this point will continue to be stated clearly in the minutes, governor's press meetings and the monthly reports on the economy.

8. The economy has stopped deteriorating for the moment as shown by the recently published first quarter GDP numbers. Our concern, however, is that the stabilizing tendency is maintained mainly by the stimulus from the fiscal side and that significant uncertainties remain as to the possibility of sustained recovery when the fiscal stimulus starts to run out later this fiscal year. Of course, the current easy monetary policy attempts to maximize such a possibility. Many pieces of new information on the economy will continue to be published. Most of such data, however, contains more information on the current state of the economy than on its future behavior. We will maintain our forward looking approach by avoiding to respond carelessly to short-run news about the economy and yet by trying to discover long-run trends in the economy from the totality of the small pieces of information we accumulate. In any case, I think it will take us quite a few more studies of new data before we can declare that deflationary concerns are over.",,Positive,0.615493536,,
"Jul. 13, 1999","Speech by Yutaka Yamaguchi, Deputy Governor of the Bank of Japan, at the Japan Center for Economic Research on July 13, 1999 (The Role of Central Banks in International Finance)","Introduction
Today, I would like to discuss the role of central banks in international finance. The reasons why I chose this subject, and not the Japanese economy or its financial system, or the monetary policy of the Bank of Japan, are twofold. The first and foremost is that responding to the changes in the international financial markets has become a very important issue to the future of the Japanese economy, as evident from the financial crises involving the emerging economies since Thailand in the summer of 1997. The other reason is because we feel that the international activities of the Bank of Japan is not well understood, relative to the contributions the Bank has made so far. In the next hour or so, I would begin with some salient features of recent international financial crises and the roles of central banks therein. This would be followed by a discussion of the activities of the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) Committee on the Global Financial System (CGFS), which I have had the pleasure of chairing since last May. Finally, I would conclude my remarks today by briefly explaining the role of the Bank of Japan in international finance.

2.The Change in Nature of International Financial Crises
International financial crises in the 1990's
Let me begin by laying down some observations on the changes in the phenomena we call international financial crises. In the discussion of ""international financial crises"", we can, of course, begin by arguing what is a ""crisis"" and whether a crisis becomes ""international"". Let us, however, leave such question of exact definitions aside and look at those financial crises that had international repercussions.

Such international financial crises are not something new. The British suffered a severe attack on the Sterling in 1967. The U.S. dollar's convertibility to gold was suspended in 1971, with serious international consequences. The mounting debt borne by the developing countries was a serious concern during the 1980's. We can conclude that the international financial markets had suffered a number of shocks or crises in the past, and thus, crises have been recurrent. However, if we look back on more recent crises, the Japanese bubble and its aftermath in the 1990's, the Nordic banking crises in the first half of this decade, the attack on the ERM in 1992, the Mexican crisis of 1994-95, and the turmoil in the emerging market economies beginning with east Asia in the summer of 1997 and followed by Russia and Brazil, it seems that the nature of crises has been changing, from what we had experienced in the 1960's to 1980's as we approach the next millennium. The most evident features are that we are experiencing more frequent crises, and when crises occur, their effects are severer and global. In this respect, I would like to draw your attention to the following four aspects.

Macroeconomic imbalances and the malfunctioning of credit allocation systems
The first point is that many international financial crises follow a period of unprecedented boom, and is the result of or is aggravated by interactions between macroeconomic imbalances and the malfunctioning of the banking or the credit allocation system. When an economy enters into an unsustainable economic boom, expectations of strong growth in the demand of goods and services becomes predominant. Investments are planned and conducted to fill these expected demands, and this, in turn, increases actual demand. Such a cycle will also result in an expansion in credit, which supports the investment boom. For example, in Japan during the bubble years, we have seen sizable expansion of credit in the form of increases in bank lending and issuances in the capital markets. Meanwhile, in the case of the Asian economies, bank lending from developed countries increased at an annual rate of nineteen percent in the years between 1990 and 1996 (twenty-seven percent per annum in the last three years). Unfortunately, such a virtuous cycle cannot be maintained forever, and when it stops, investments quickly turn into excess capacity and the recouping of capital becomes impossible. In the course of this process, a large part of financial assets turn into non-performing assets. If the volumes are large enough to impair the functioning of the financial system, the whole macroeconomy will stagnate. In this way, the interaction between macroeconomic imbalances and the malfunctioning of the financial system leads to financial crises. This relationship is often described by central banks as the interaction between monetary and financial stability; the macroeconomic stability, i.e., non-inflationary sustainable growth and the stability of financial system are interdependent. Our experiences of recent financial crises underscore the importance of such interaction.

Volatility of short-term capital flows
The second point, which is closely related with the first, is the deepening of crises by sudden changes in short-term capital flows. As I have mentioned already, bank credit to the Asian countries expanded significantly in the years preceding the crisis. During the same period from 1990 to 1996, the share of credit maturing in less than one year has increased by more than ten percentage points, from fifty-two percent to sixty-three percent. Short term extensions of credit do not cause problems if they are rolled over. However, when the borrower can no longer roll over its debt, and funds begin to flow outwards, the borrower quickly faces severe liquidity problems. The Asian crises showed us that the disruptions in the economies and financial markets in these circumstances could be very serious. In a number of cases, they could be far more serious than adjustments that would have been warranted to correct the macroeconomic imbalances that existed before the crisis. In this context, while the merits of capital inflows should also be fully recognized, the volatility of short term capital flows is an important issue in dealing with international financial crises.

International contagion of crises
My third observation is that there seems to be more international transmission of financial crises. For example, when the Latin American debt problem deepened in the 1980's, effects on other continents were muted and Asia did not suffer serious financial crises. The situation was similar during the Mexican crisis of 1994-95. However, in the most recent financial crisis beginning in 1997, the wave of disruptions reached many emerging market economies, sometimes quickly, and in other cases slowly. The transmission mechanism was not singular: rapid declines in credit extensions to the region by developed countries were significant in some cases, whereas in others it was the proxy hedge (i.e., hedging by selling other currencies with similar risk characteristics) or purely psychological transmissions of bearish sentiments. It might be said that the crisis that began in Asia swept around the world to end, seemingly, upon reaching Brazil. In the past, we have seen contagion of financial crisis within a region where there are significant interactions in terms of trade and investment flows and/or the economic structure is similar. Contagion to other regions of the globe is a new phenomenon not observed in the 1970's or 1980's.

More diverse manifestation of crises
Finally, I should point out that financial crises are now manifesting themselves in diverse ways. A classic financial crisis is when the financial system is strained by funding problems, for example when bank after bank is hit by depositor runs. Of course, in the most recent crisis involving the emerging market economies, many countries, such as Thailand, Korea, Russia and Brazil, suffered quintessential foreign currency funding problems. Meanwhile, we saw another type of crisis: if a classic financial crisis is precipitated by bank runs, the new type of crisis results from impairment of market functioning and such crisis could be termed a ""market run"". When Long Term Capital Management (LTCM) almost collapsed last autumn, liquidity dried up in many markets of the developed countries as many market participants dumped their assets in ""fire-sales"" and flight to quality became ever more pronounced. If we recognize that an important function of financial markets is to price financial assets and transfer risks at that price, i.e., ""price discovery"", the impairment of such a function is threatening to market participants.

Why are international crises becoming more pronounced?
Having said that the four features of recent international financial crises are the interactions between macroeconomic imbalances and the functioning of the financial system, the volatility of short-term capital flows, international contagion, and diversity in the manifestation of crises, I would like to spend some time to discuss why these changes might have occurred. I do not have a definite answer, but I agree with many experts who point out that financial innovation and globalization, enabled by advances in information technology, have had a role. For example, cross-border flows of capital have increased more than threefold in the last ten years. What strikes us more is that the cross-border transfer of risks increased rapidly through derivatives transactions. As a hypothetical case, if we think of an investment in a bond denominated in Thai baht issued by a Thai firm, the investor faces various risks: foreign exchange risk, credit risk of the firm, interest rate risk, etc. Derivatives enable investors to unbundle these risks packaged in a bond into component risks--e.g., the risk that the credit standing of the issuing firm or the Thai baht exchange rate falls below a certain threshold--and transfer and/or assume them at will. Financial innovation has enabled market participants to engage in these operations at significantly lower costs, and this has resulted in an expansion of transaction volumes. The expansion in transaction volumes draws the attention of market participants to the need of more harmonized rules underlying financial transactions--payment and settlement systems and accounting standards--and encourages reforms therein. These reforms push the rules in the direction of standardization, which in turn, lower the costs of transactions and leads to a further increase in transaction volumes. Such globalizing financial marketplace facilitates a further division of labor: the development of risk appraisal services , investment funds, including hedge funds, tailored to suit diverse risk appetites should be understood in this context.

Accordingly, risk evaluation and risk taking become more specialized and tightly focused. This could result in a particular type of risk being singled out and transferred when crises or imbalances become apparent. In the example of a Thai firm issuing bonds denominated in Thai baht, investors in the bonds could guard against the depreciation of the baht by efficiently hedging the foreign exchange risk with derivatives, which is likely to result in higher pressures of selling baht hedges.

It is, however, not fair to emphasize only the deepening of crises as a result of financial innovation and globalization. In the case of East Asian countries, their incredible economic growth during the 1980's and up to the recent crisis was the result of their taking advantage of capital inflows from abroad. Capital inflows not only supplemented domestic investment funds, but also facilitated the transfer of industrial technology and know-how. In this context, derivatives enabled the unbundling of various risks embedded in economic transactions and the transfer of risks to other market participants. Such opportunities should have mitigated the perception of high risks associated with investments in emerging market economies and stimulated investments. Meanwhile, in a broader context, market discipline is also enforced through global market activities. Those that succeed in maintaining sound economic performance through determined efforts of restructuring, be they firms, financial institutions, or sovereign states, would be rewarded by the markets in the form of narrower credit spreads and thus lower funding costs. Market discipline stemming from the global capital market, therefore, is a driving force of robust economic growth in the long run.

Financial innovation and the globalization of financial markets, like any change, have both positive and negative effects: although positive effects may materialize in the long run, some disruptions may be expected in the short run. This means that our goal should be to devise plans to take the greatest advantage of financial innovation and globalization and implement them as well as possible. In other words, it is becoming important for each market participant, including firms, financial institutions and sovereign states, to recognize the role of market discipline, and, at the same time, lay down rules and practices that are compatible with the globalizing markets.

3.Central Banks and International Financial Crises
In the international financial community, governments, central banks, financial institutions, and the academia are now engaged in a hot debate over the reform of international financial system, including exchange rate regimes and short term capital flows. The purpose of such discussions is to prevent a resurgence of international financial crises, and they are founded on the recognition that the nature of international financial crises may be changing, as I have just noted. In the next few minutes, I will carve out a niche in this very broad debate, and try to explain the roles that central banks could play with regard to international financial crises.

From this perspective, the most important responsibility for central banks is to maintain the stability of their own macroeconomy. More precisely, central banks are expected to maintain sustainable growth under stable prices. Putting one's house in order is the starting point. Unfortunately, however, implementing the correct policies to maintain the stability of the domestic economy and financial system alone does not guarantee a stable international financial system. The discussions on international financial architecture, which I have just referred to, seem to underscore the fact that efforts to maintain the functioning of international financial markets or the international financial system are just as important.

Monitoring the state of the international financial system
First and foremost, central banks should strengthen their ability to understand the risks and vulnerabilities in the international financial system. More simply, central banks should enhance their monitoring abilities. As mentioned a little earlier, a period of strong growth may sow the seeds of the next crisis by allowing excesses in consumption and investment. In fact, if we look back after the fact, we can often find signs warning of ""bubbles"" or excesses. For example, before 1997, i.e., before the Asian crisis, the BIS Banking Statistics indicated that banks in the developed countries were increasing their short-term foreign currency lending to the Asian countries. The increase in short-term foreign currency liabilities is likely to leave a country prone to a rapid outflow of capital and hence could lead to foreign currency liquidity problems. The reason why such warning signs were overlooked or ignored seems to be associated with national confidence. Past financial bubbles seem to be inevitably associated with such confidence shared by the general public. In Asia, there was the talk of the Asian miracle. A little earlier, during the Japanese bubble years, the oft-cited phrase ""the largest creditor country"" was an indication of such confidence. When the mood of a country is upbeat, the recognition of risks--even severe down-side risks--are not easily acknowledged. Even if it were possible to identify such risks, it would have been extremely difficult to take the necessary corrective actions, either at the micro level (strengthening risk management) or at the macro level (tightening monetary policy). Even if such risks are initially contained through appropriate corrective measures, market participants' risk appetite may be so strong as to eventually render those corrective measures ineffective, and lead to a bubble. There is no panacea which quickly dissipates macroeconomic risks.

Nevertheless, it is extremely important for central banks to understand the risk factors and consciously analyze what could happen if there are significant changes in those risk factors. As a result of the most recent financial crisis, it became widely recognized that private financial institutions perform stress tests to identify vulnerabilities in their own portfolios. Stress tests may seem to be technical, but they are not. They are actually fundamentally judgmental processes for the management of financial institutions where various scenarios are employed to identify risks that endanger the existence of each institution. Likewise, it has become apparent that central banks should also adopt a similar approach--in effect stress testing at the macro level. By this, I am not arguing that central banks can always make the right judgment concerning risks to the macroeconomy. Nevertheless, I can stress that it is the raison d'etre for central banks to identify risks that would endanger the policy objectives that are conferred upon them, namely the stability of the macroeconomy (sustainable growth under price stability) and the financial system. I should say, therefore, that in this globalizing world, it is becoming ever more important for central banks to make joint efforts to understand the risks in the global financial markets.

Policy recommendations for a more robust international financial system
Secondly, even if central banks could understand the conditions of the international financial system in extreme detail, they would probably not be able to prevent every financial crisis. This means that, central banks should contribute to the strengthening of the international financial system--building a system that could withstand crises and stress that are facts of life--through appropriate policy recommendations. I have used the word policy recommendations, because central banks do not usually have direct authority to make rules or supervise the international financial markets or their participants. For example, in the recent debate over how to deal with institutional investors including hedge funds, most central banks do not have any rule-making or supervisory authority over them. In such cases, the central banks look to other authorities to make and implement proper policy responses. There are also areas where no regulator or supervisor has formal authority, and the authorities are presently discussing how and whether to fill such gaps.

However, stemming from central banks' status as being players in markets, central banks have a strong interest in improving the functioning of markets. Accordingly, central banks could adopt a constructive approach: to analyze the global financial markets and make policy recommendations, which are to be implemented through dialogs with market participants and supervisory authorities. Along with such efforts, central banks must not neglect to improve their own operations, such as payment and settlement services, which can be modified through their own initiatives in response to the globalization of financial markets.

Responses to international financial crises
Third, but not the least, central banks must consider appropriate responses to international financial crises once they happen. In many cases international crises involve rapid depreciation of currencies or depletion of foreign exchange reserves, and manifest themselves as near or actual defaults of governments or private market participants. In such instances, extension of assistance from international financial institutions or governments could result in moral hazard, just like the domestic context, so it should not be too readily extended. The recent emphasis of debate on private sector involvement has sprung from this context. Nevertheless, if the effects on the international financial system would have been deemed to be severe in the absence of public sector involvement, public assistance had been granted. While such direct assistance has been the domain of IMF and national governments, central banks have been more concerned with maintaining the stability of the international financial system through maintaining the stability of domestic financial systems.

Central banks are ""in the market"", so to speak. As a result, they are able to collect up-to-date information on ever changing market conditions. In this context, central banks occasionally function as the lender of the last resort, in response to systemic risks posed by funding problems at private financial institutions. Of course, central banks must be careful so as not to create moral hazard. Meanwhile, when disruptions in international financial markets could affect the domestic financial markets or the domestic economy through global linkages between markets, central banks may consider lowering interest rates and supplying ample liquidity. For example, when the Federal Reserve lowered its federal fund rates three times last autumn, as the U.S. financial markets became unsettled following the Russian crisis, the reason behind the move was to cushion the effects on prospective economic growth of increasing weakness in foreign economies and of less accommodative financial conditions domestically.

4.Committee on the Global Financial System
An international forum for central banks
The three elements of the role of central banks in international finance, which I have just mentioned, understanding markets, formulating policy recommendations for strengthening the financial system, and containing crises when they happen, have always been played by central banks in order to maintain the stability of the domestic financial system. As a result, central banks tend to share a common framework, which facilitates exchanges of information and views. This common framework is further strengthened through central banks' interactions with the markets--markets that are globalizing--in their day to day operations. There are many channels for such exchanges, and one of the most important is through the Bank for International Settlements (BIS). Many of you would probably know that the BIS is a unique international organization owned by central banks of more than forty countries.

Many committees of central banks meet at the BIS, led by the Governors of the Central Banks of the Group of Ten Countries (G10 Governors). The activities of the Committee on the Global Financial System (CGFS), the Basle Committee on Banking Supervision, and the Committee on Payment and Settlement Systems, in particular, are closely interconnected. Today, I would like to outline the activities of the CGFS, which I am involved in, and which is closely related to the theme of my discussion on the roles of central banks in international finance.

Monitoring of international financial markets
The activities of the CGFS can be grouped into three areas.

The first is to conduct comprehensive monitoring of the global financial market. This corresponds to the accurate appraisal of risks in the global market, which I stressed just a few minutes ago. At the quarterly meetings of the Committee, we focus on various risk factors and discuss what could be the risks that central banks should be most aware of. Diverse issues are taken up, but much attention has been paid to the origins and effects of the recent wave of financial crises beginning in Asia. For example, why were the ""Asian Tiger Economies"" suddenly faced with currency crises? What were the risks posed by the devaluation of the Thai baht to her Asian neighbors and to other emerging market economies? Why does the devaluation by Brazil not seem to have had great effects at least in the short run? We have also examined issues involving the developed countries such as the market trends in the run up to and after the introduction of the euro at the beginning of this year, and the inherent risks in the rising U.S. equity markets. The Y2K risk premia observed in many markets for transactions over this year's end is also an issue that we have focused on. Furthermore, as a longer term issue, we have looked at the restructuring of the international banking industry, which is the reflection of changing nature of banking business.

There is no standard methodology for such monitoring exercises, but one aspect that the Committee is now particularly interested in is how to understand ""positions"" in the marketplace. For example, in the case of market turmoil involving LTCM, it is said that there were considerable arbitrage positions involving bonds of developed countries and emerging market economies: buying emerging market bonds and selling developed country bonds with the expectation that the spreads between the two classes of bonds should narrow. The speculation that this huge overhang of positions would be unwound was behind the disruptions we saw following the Russian default and huge losses at hedge funds. Of course, there are as many purchasers as sellers in the market, and all positions sum to zero. Nevertheless, the reaction of the market following a shock is dependent on who holds the positions, how concentrated the positions are, whether positions are correlated, etc. Paying attention to positions, therefore, is based on a view of the economy or the market that the positions are no less important factors in causing large market fluctuations than macroeconomic fundamentals. The CGFS also shares such views.

Improving the functioning of markets
The second element of the work program of the CGFS is longer term research with a view to improving market functioning. This begins with studies involving actual market practices: what sort of transactions are conducted day to day, how such transactions are executed and settled, what are the problems experienced by market participants, etc. Such information constitutes a part of understanding the markets and is also very important as input into crisis management.

The third area of the Committee's activities is closely related to, in fact based on, such research: examining alternate policy responses and the elaboration of corresponding policy recommendations to promote the development of well-functioning and robust financial markets and systems. Needless to say, these policy recommendations are shaped by past events and experiences in the international financial markets and driven by the keen interests of the Committee to prevent another disruption in market functions.

In this context, the most important activity of the Committee is its efforts to improve the transparency of markets through improvements in disclosure and statistics. Substantial improvements of market transparency would lead market participants to closely evaluate and select their counterparties and hopefully market equilibrium would be achieved to a certain extent. Central banks have long attached great importance to such mechanisms in the market that imposes self-discipline.

From this long line of work, I would like to draw your attention to the Committee's publication of a report titled ""Review of the Disclosure Template Regarding the Authorities' Foreign Currency Liquidity Position"" last autumn. This report is based on our recognition that one of the reasons for the deepening of the Asian crisis may have been the lack of transparency in the levels of official foreign exchange reserves: for example, Thai and Korean monetary authorities had conducted support operations of their currencies in the forward markets or assisted the foreign currency funding of domestic banks by depositing foreign currency at those banks. As a result of such operations, the actual amount of foreign reserves available to the authorities had substantially declined, but it was not reflected in official statistics on foreign exchange reserves. Accordingly, the Report recommends that public authorities disclose a more comprehensive, detailed and timely information on their foreign currency liquidity positions: e.g., the disclosure of potential drain on foreign exchange reserves through forward and options transactions, and the amount of foreign exchange reserves deposited at domestic banks, every month with one month timeliness. This initiative by the central banks was taken up by the IMF and incorporated in the Special Data Dissemination Standards, with which many countries, including Japan, are committed to comply.

Something that is as important as, if not more than, disclosure by public authorities is disclosure by private market participants themselves. In this regard, we should not forget what happened to LTCM last autumn. As we all know, LTCM was not able to fund itself when markets moved against its huge leveraged positions. If counterparties to LTCM had been able to find out that LTCM was holding some extreme positions through disclosures or macro statistics, market discipline might have been able to appraise the levels of position taking. In order for market participants to accurately measure various risks--market risk, credit risk, liquidity risk, etc.--improvements in disclosure and macro statistics are two sides of the same coin, and the CGFS has pursued both issues.

As to disclosure by private market participants, the Committee published the Fisher Report in fall 1994, advocating that disclosure needs to evolve from one based on financial statements to one providing information more accurately reflecting the risk profiles, including results of risk management model calculations. In the Report, it was noted that since individual market participants should wish to be correctly evaluated by the market, they should have the incentive to enhance disclosure, and a competitive mechanism to improve disclosure might be at work. However, as I have just pointed out, in the recent international financial crisis, one problem was that only insufficient information was provided to market participants. If so, it becomes necessary to examine why the competitive enhancement of disclosure did not materialize and what could we do to make it work. The Committee, with inputs from market participants, is spending considerable efforts, with an aim to devise a framework to enhance disclosure.

Along with these efforts to improve disclosure by the public sector and private market participants, the CGFS is expending considerable resources to improve statistics on international financial markets. For example, the BIS and national central banks, following a recommendation in a 1995 report by the Committee, launched a comprehensive market survey of global derivatives markets, the first in 1995 and the second in 1998. Another product is a more regular statistics based on a survey of major derivatives dealers covering more than 80% of global markets in derivatives (""Yoshikuni Statistics""), which was first published in December last year. In addition, there have been constant upgrades to existing BIS Banking Statistics: for example, the publication of the BIS Semiannual Consolidated International Banking Statistics, which is now watched closely as a leading indicator of country risk, is now approximately two months earlier than in the past. The CGFS is further looking into any gaps in statistics that may be filled.

As I have mentioned, in addition to improving market transparency, there is another distinct group of work in the activities of the CGFS. International financial crises are the consequences of market participants' taking and unwinding of positions. The Committee has studied such dynamics of markets and published recommendations based on its findings. One such example is the publication of a report titled ""Market Liquidity: Research Findings and Selected Policy Responses"" in May this year. Market liquidity is admittedly an elusive concept and is difficult to quantify. Nevertheless, market participants and authorities are making their day to day decision on the assumption that market is always liquid. One example is the risk management models, which is rapidly gaining acceptance. Such models assume that assets and liabilities can always be liquidated in the market immediately at prevailing market prices, i.e., the existence of market liquidity. If this assumption does not hold, the result could be unexpectedly large losses, or worse, bankruptcy of some market participants. This illustrates that maintaining the liquidity of markets would play an important role in upholding the stability of the financial system. The Report, from a conceptual viewpoint, identifies the determinants of market liquidity according to product design, market microstructure and the behavior of market participants, with a strong focus on the liquidity of the government securities market, which is one of the core financial markets. Of the policy implications that are pointed out in the Report, the effects on market liquidity of the issuing maturity and lot of government bonds and taxes offer valuable insights into how we can enhance liquidity in the market of Japanese government securities.

Concerning these recent activities of the CGFS, it should be recognized that the Committee is not working in a vacuum. In order to better play the role of central banks in international financial crises, be it the understanding of risks, developing robust systems, or containing crises, the CGFS should work in concert with other fora. For example, of the other Basle-based G10 committees, the Basle Committee on Banking Supervision pays attention to issues involving regulation and supervision of individual banks. The Committee on Payment and Settlement System (CPSS) focuses on the stability and efficiency of the payment and settlement systems, which are the infrastructure of financial systems. Compared with these two committees, the orientation of CGFS is on markets.

In any case, the activities of these and other fora should become more important as financial markets are further globalized. This April, the Financial Stability Forum, established to strengthen cooperation among the Group of Seven countries and various international organizations with a view to enhancing international financial stability, held its first meeting. The Chairman of the CGFS was asked to participate in this new forum along with the Chair of the Basle Committee, the CPSS, IOSCO (International Organization of Securities Commissions) and IAIS (International Organization of Insurance Supervisors). This, I believe, means that the CGFS is expected to make contributions from its market-oriented perspective.

5.The Role of the Bank of Japan in International Finance
Finally, I would like to briefly describe the role of the Bank of Japan in international finance. In the new Bank of Japan Law, effective since April last year, provisions that allow the Bank to conduct activities related to international finance based on its judgments have been stipulated reflecting the globalization of finance. The Bank performs many functions: e.g., intervening in foreign exchange markets as an agent of the Finance Minister, providing services to foreign central banks and international organizations wishing to invest in yen. In addition, the Bank is actively engaged in activities related to international finance through channels other than the BIS, including the G7, G10, IMF, etc. In the remaining minutes I would like to take up, from this broad spectrum, a few issues that are related to the role of our Bank with respect to international financial crises.

Understanding developments in international financial markets
First, let me explain the monitoring activities of the Bank of Japan with respect to international financial markets. The Bank is closely following developments in international financial markets in addition to its monitoring of the domestic economy and financial markets, and the outputs of such monitoring is reflected in the Bank's policy decisions involving both monetary and prudential policy. For example, the international effects of the Russian crisis of August last year was profound, and concerns about the repercussions of such effects on the Japanese economy were factored into the decision to lower the target money market rates in September last year. Another example involves the effects of the Asian crisis on the funding operations of Japanese banks. Japanese banks had been burdened with non-performing assets, and the Bank of Japan was concerned with the additional impacts of the crisis on banks--the possibility of further deterioration of their assets or potentially severer credit evaluation towards Japanese banks which could cause difficulties in their foreign currency funding. The Bank of Japan carefully monitored the international financial markets by closely contacting domestic banks and overseas authorities, facilitating the funding operations of Japanese banks in the domestic markets--I will elaborate on this point later. Fortunately, the tensions in the international financial markets began to ease in the latter half of October last year, and in line with this, the external pressures on Japanese financial markets also declined rapidly.

As the domestic and the overseas financial markets move more and more towards convergence, the Bank of Japan intends to enhance its monitoring activities further, particularly on the Asian economies and financial markets.

Contributions to international rulemaking
My second point involves contributions to policy formulation at the international level. One implication of the globalization of financial markets is that we can no longer be self-sufficient in the rules related to financial transactions. The trend is the application of internationally developed rules in the domestic sphere. The Basle Accord of 1988 was probably a landmark in this context. Since globalization is inevitable, the Bank of Japan must contribute to enhancing the stability of the international financial system through making efforts towards designing and implementing rules that it sees most appropriate. Of course, such rules are not under the sole jurisdiction of central banks, but we are aiming to make contributions from the perspective of central banks. The active participation of the Bank in various fora which I have just mentioned-- Basle-based committees, EMEAP (Executives' Meeting of East Asia-Pacific Central Banks), fora in which governments are also members, etc.--is based on this judgment. In addition, various technical assistance, including those in the area of payment and settlement systems, provided by our Bank to central banks of the emerging market economies should also contribute to enhancing the stability of the international financial system.

Containing crises relating to international finance
As my final point on the role of the Bank of Japan, I would like to discuss the Bank's role in containing crises relating to international finance.

Once a crisis develops and its possible threats to international finance becomes more than negligible, potential use of multilateral or bilateral liquidity support becomes an issue. A typical situation is when credit needs to be extended to countries facing crises. In such cases, support packages have usually been arranged by the IMF. Central banks' involvement is characterized by their nature as a provider of short-term liquidity, and the Bank of Japan has cooperated in international financial support by, for example, sharing responsibilities in BIS bridge loans.

Moreover, developments in international finance are affecting Japanese financial markets. For example, since the summer of 1998, the worries about the Japanese financial system were heightened, following events such as rumors over the financial health of the Long Term Credit Bank. This was compounded with concerns over credit crunch in the international financial market stemming from the Russian crisis and problems at some U.S. hedge funds, with the result that many Japanese banks experienced difficulties in securing foreign currency funding. Under such circumstances, the so-called ""Japan premium""--the extra risk premium charged to Japanese financial institutions reflecting market participants' heightened concerns over their creditworthiness--increased significantly. At the same time, Japanese banks entered into swap transactions to obtain much needed foreign currency funding--such transactions are, from the viewpoint of Japanese banks, exchange of yen funds for dollar funds for a certain period. These operations by banks put significant upward pressures on short-term domestic money market rates. In response, the Bank of Japan conducted money market operations to provide year-end funding earlier than usual to mitigate funding problems at Japanese banks.

Meanwhile, foreign banks, which had entered into currency swap transactions with Japanese banks, needed investment instruments for the yen they acquired. During the financial crises, credit risk-free instruments were sought, and the choice of foreign banks was Japanese government short-term financing bills (FBs) and the bills drawn by the Bank of Japan. Bank of Japan bills were originally intended to serve as instruments to absorb excess reserves in the interbank market, but foreign banks regarded them as favorable investment instruments. In retrospect, there might have even been periods when the Bank's bills played a large role in inducing foreign banks to enter into currency swap transactions. In effect, an overview of the monetary flows at the time suggests that the provision of year-end funding and the issuance of short-term bills by the Bank of Japan to stabilize the domestic financial markets worked to recycle liquidity between Japanese and foreign banks, and facilitated the foreign currency funding of Japanese banks.

I might add that, although often overlooked, it is important to note that these operations can only be effective when the assets of the Bank of Japan is sound and the bills issued are risk-free. The Bank's effectiveness, especially during crises, as experienced during the unprecedented period of concurrent crises in the domestic and overseas financial markets recently, relies on the soundness of the Bank's balance sheet. This is one reason why the Bank is, as it should be, sensitive about maintaining the quality of its assets.

Today, I have had the pleasure of speaking to you on the role of central banks in international finance. As a final note I would like to stress that globalization affects not only financial institutions and non-financial firms but also central banks as well. Due to limitation over time, I could not touch upon profound changes in the banking services provided by central banks, for example, in the area of payments and settlements. The changes that we are experiencing now--financial innovation and globalization of financial markets--may be a radical change equivalent to the Industrial Revolution of the eighteenth century. Just as the eighteenth-century Britons probably did not recognize that they were in the midst of such a revolution, we may be unknowingly in the midst of a watershed event. The introduction of the euro in Europe and serious discussions on the pros and cons of dollarization in some Latin American countries seem to be very symbolic, as the new millennium is dawning. If I draw upon the remarks that Nobel laureate Hicks made almost thirty years ago, central banks may no longer be at the center and become local banks as a result of globalization. In order for central banks to continue making their contributions to the stability of the economy and the financial system, they must review their policies and operations in accordance with the ongoing globalization. The Bank of Japan is also determined to tackle such challenges ahead.

"Jul. 27, 1999","Speech given by Masaru Hayami, Governor of the Bank of Japan, at the Kisaragi-kai meeting in Tokyo on July 27, 1999 (Challenges for the Japanese Economy)","Introduction
It is a great privilege to be invited to the Kisaragi-Kai meeting to make a speech in front of this distinguished audience.

First, I will make use of this opportunity to discuss the current state of the Japanese economy. Then I will move on to the main theme--structural problems that have to be faced in revitalizing the economy. I hope that my view will give you some perspectives for the future.

II. Recent Developments in the Economy and the Outlook
Let me begin with the Bank of Japan's view on the current state of the Japanese economy and the outlook: Japan's economy, at present, has stopped deteriorating, and corporate sentiment has improved slightly, however, clear signs of a self-sustained recovery in private demand have not been observed yet. The following factors have combined to keep the Japanese economy from a further deterioration. First, active fiscal policy has been stimulating public investments as well as housing investments. Second, private firms have been reducing their inventories successfully helped to some extent by the development of final demand. Third, financial conditions are improving, as a result of the Bank of Japan's zero interest rate policy and the injection of public funds into major commercial banks. The buoyancy in the stock market since early spring and the improvements in corporate sector confidence shown in the Tankan, are based on the increased anticipation of better business and financial conditions in the future, as well as the current improvements in final demand, output, and inventories.

It is, however, uncertain at this stage whether the Japanese economy, is on the way to a self-sustained recovery as anticipated above. The reasons can be summarized as follows.

To begin with, I will address two factors that will have a negative effect on the future of the economy. First, the stimulus effects of public investment will fade out eventually. Second, the corporate restructuring efforts of individual firms will expose the macro economy to downside pressures. This is an example where what are rational strategies from the viewpoint of individual firms may have undesirable effects on the economy as a whole. With corporate restructuring, workers faced with harsh income conditions, reduce consumption spending, while firms save the resulting cash or make debt repayments, instead of reinvesting. This ""paradox of thrift"" may drive our economy into shrinkage.

Of course, there are factors that will work positively on the economy. The point is, however, whether these factors are strong enough to outweigh the negative ones mentioned above.

Let me discuss the positive factors in detail. First, corporate restructuring may bring about a recovery in corporate profits--and may push up stock prices in anticipation of such a recovery. For the recent corporate restructuring to have a positive effect, the profits recovery should boost firms' spending sufficiently to outweigh workers' saving.

The second positive factor is that the effects of the government's various measures to ensure the stability of the financial system and the Bank of Japan's monetary policy to ease financial conditions are permeating throughout the economy, improving household and corporate sector confidence somewhat. Furthermore, there is a possibility that this improved confidence will stimulate the spending attitude of consumers and firms. In fact, household consumption has held steady even amid the harsh income conditions. However, corporate expenditure is still weak, as is obvious from the Tankan survey on business fixed investment plans. While financial institutions are improving their skill in risk management and striving for adequate lending margins, bank loans have not increased while demand for fund raising remains weak.

The third positive factor is a recovery in overseas economies, especially in Asia. Although China's economy is decelerating somewhat, Korea is now on a recovery trend. Thailand and the Philippines as well as Malaysia and Singapore are bottoming out gradually. These developments will facilitate Japanese exports and production.

The above arguments make obvious the following fact: if foreign economic factors are not considered, the recovery of the Japanese economy depends largely on when corporate behavior becomes active. The recent improvements in corporate sector confidence are good signs for the economy, but other economic indicators and fixed investment plans show no significant signs of economic recovery. Our judgment is that it is too early to say that the Japanese economy is on the way to a self-sustained recovery. Therefore, the downward pressure on prices will remain, although prices have been stable recently.

It is in view of such economic conditions as those described above that the Bank of Japan will maintain the current monetary easing stance and continue to firmly support economic activities until deflationary concerns subside.

III. Contained Dynamism of the Japanese Economy
A caveat regarding fiscal and monetary policies is that they are effective in managing the economy in the short run, but are not a panacea for all of the problems the Japanese economy faces.

This last decade of the 20th century has seen the Japanese economy experience its lowest growth since the end of the Second World War. Despite several economic stimulus measures from both the monetary and fiscal side, the response of the economy has been generally slow and we have yet to confirm any clear revival of economic dynamism led by private demand. Taking into account the weakness of private demand over the past ten years, it is perhaps natural to think that there might be something ""structural"" which has contained economic dynamism. If this is the case, it is difficult to expect a long-lasting recovery, if any, based solely on macroeconomic stimulus measures. Hence, to restore vitality to the Japanese economy in the medium term, painstaking efforts must be made to resolve each structural problem so as to enable the nation's economic potential to fully blossom. And such efforts are also necessary if both monetary and fiscal policy are to have their full effect.

Since many structural problems stem from the supply side of the economy, resolving them requires that we send the appropriate signal and give the right incentives to the public. As evidenced by Reaganomics in the U.S. and Thatcherism in the U.K., supply-side policies would most likely be accompanied by various pains and require a long period until reforms take root among the public and bear real fruit. It is indeed for this reason that we need to reach an early consensus as to the nature of the structural problems in Japan and thus come up with the right prescriptions.

Some say that structural problems encompass a variety of issues, not only economic ones but also demographic, educational, and environmental ones. But, today, I will focus on three economic issues which are interrelated and have a particularly strong impact on Japan's macroeconomic performance: first, the delay in cleaning up the balance sheet of firms; second, changes in economic growth mechanisms under globalization; and third, the imbalance between savings and investment.

IV. Delay in Cleaning Up the Balance Sheets of Firms
The most immediate lingering structural problem is that we have not yet completed the disposal of assets and liabilities that ballooned during the bubble period. In the wake of the bursting of the bubble, we first saw the collapse of firms which had expanded their liabilities based on aggressive management plans, and then the accumulation of non-performing assets on the part of financial institutions. This, in turn, reduced the risk-taking ability of financial institutions by eroding their capital position, resulting in impairing the smooth circulation of money in the economy. In addition, a loss of credibility in the financial system triggered by the collapse of some financial institutions worried depositors and financial markets alike, and seems to have contributed to the economic deterioration witnessed during 1997 and 1998 through a worsening of household and corporate sector confidence.

The disposal of the non-performing assets of financial institutions has made considerable progress, at least from the accounting viewpoint, thanks to efforts on the part of financial institutions as well as capital injection into major banks using public funds. Needless to say, financial institutions must make further efforts, including the removal of non-performing assets from their balance sheets.

It should be noted that balance sheet erosion is not limited to firms which have already gone bankrupt and the financial institutions which extended loans to them. Although not on the verge of suspending business, not a few firms misjudged demand during the bubble period and made large fixed investments or launched new businesses which turned out to be totally unprofitable. These firms have only just been managing to repay the debt while suffering from worsening asset efficiency and a high debt ratio. The often heard cases of ""excess capacity"" and ""excess debt"" have been partly attributed to the business cycle, but fundamentally they should be interpreted in this context of the debt overhang from the bubble period.

There is little doubt that the delay in cleaning up corporate balance sheets lies behind the slow recovery of fixed investments despite extremely low interest rates. Indeed, there are cases where financial institutions have been obliged to be cautious in extending additional loans to firms lagging in improving their financial condition, even if they have new projects which are expected to be profitable. It is pointed out that this is partly because financial technology is not well developed in separating the risk related to a firm from that related to a project which the firm undertakes like in project finance. It thus seems unlikely that the Japanese economy will regain dynamism without an improvement in the balance sheets of the corporate sector.

V. The U.S. Experience--A Case of ""Creative Destruction""
Often asked questions include: ""How can the corporate sector scrap unprofitable businesses and obsolete equipment?"" ""Once the corporate sector has downsized unprofitable sectors, how will it lead to revitalization of the whole economy?"" To answer these questions, it is perhaps instructive to look at the past 20 years' experience of the U.S. The U.S. faced such problems as dwindling productivity growth during the 1970s and 1980s and balance sheet adjustment from the late 1980s to the early 1990s. In solving these problems, the U.S. government, particularly since the Reagan administration, has played a supporting role by promoting deregulation which has led to intensified competition and industrial revitalization. In the private sector, U.S. firms reviewed their production and management processes, and made necessary strategic adjustments, which has been labeled ""re-engineering.""

Therefore, to look at developments in the U.S. is useful in considering not only the balance sheet problem but also the kind of structural adjustment which is conducive to increasing productivity and restoring economic dynamism to the Japanese economy.

Economic recovery in the U.S. since March 1991 has often been labeled a ""jobless recovery"" because it was not initially accompanied by a significant increase in employment and private consumption. However, this gradually changed to a full-fledged recovery with an increase in both fixed investment and employment, resulting in more than eight years of expansion until now. There are, admittedly, various views with respect to the future of the U.S. economy, but it deserves attention that the Schumpeterian process of ""constructive destruction"" has often been cited to have played an important role in its success to date.

It should be noted that under such slogans as ""re-engineering"" and ""strengthening core competence,"" many U.S. firms have sold off or scrapped unprofitable sectors and concentrated management resources on profitable ones while taking full advantage of information technology. Such efforts have been responsible for a rise in their stock prices and laid the ground for further expansion in business areas where they had advantages via such methods as mergers and acquisitions. At the same time, many new firms specializing in ""high technology"" have grown rapidly with the spread of the Internet against the backdrop of across-the-board large increases in investment in information technology to improve management efficiency. In addition, it helped the economy that those who lost jobs due to corporate downsizing were smoothly reallocated to such growth areas as software and other services, including medical and nursing care, in a highly mobile labor market.

With all these factors combined, industrial structure in the U.S. has dramatically changed over the past 10 years. The 50 years' history of U.S. industry since the Second World War shows that the companies in major industries remained more or less the same during the 1950s and 1970s, including the ""Big Three in the automobile industry,"" and the big oil and steel companies. However, when comparing the 1990s with the 1970s, a number of firms specializing in ""high technology,"" which were not even established 20 years ago, are now listed among the major firms representing U.S. industry. This simple fact is deemed symbolic of the process of ""creative destruction.""

What about the situation in Japan? In the 1950s and the 1960s, the textile industry and heavy industries such as steel and chemicals developed as leading industries. In the 1970s, the rise of the automobile and electronics industries substantially changed the lineup of major firms. However, since the 1970s, there have been no substantial changes.

I hasten to add that I am not saying that the Japanese economy cannot grow unless new firms are created. There is no doubt that many existing major firms are actively pursuing the development of new technology. Indeed, in this context, we can find examples of major firms in the U.S. which have undergone a dramatic transformation from what they were 20 years ago. Having said this, recalling Shumpeter's belief that the function of an entrepreneur in the true sense is not so much to manage as to create a company, I cannot help but feel slightly disappointed that we have not yet seen the creation of many new companies which can lead the Japanese economy. A main driving force behind the buoyant development of the U.S. economy has been revitalization through intensified competition, and, if I may add another factor, ""a culture of risk taking."" In Japan, while existing firms should concentrate their management resources on business areas where they have a comparative advantage, new industries or groups of new firms should emerge to create jobs, thereby achieving growth balancing the old and new. What is important in the process is that capital stock such as equipment and technology and management resources such as human resources be liquidated and reallocated to be fully utilized in growing new business areas.

VI. Changes in the Economic Growth Mechanism under Globalization
The second structural problem Japan has to face is that as globalization progresses and the shareholdings of foreign investors increase, Japanese corporate managers have come to pursue higher rates of return rather than expansion. At the same time, rates of return in those industries which had been protected by regulations have been forced to decline. Together, these developments have put heavy adjustment pressure on the existing industrial structure.

A. Management Pursuing Higher Rates of Return
A recent survey by the Economic Planning Agency shows that Japanese corporate managers have clearly changed to now emphasize higher rates of return. Since economic stagnation continues and hardly any increase in sales is expected, it is natural for corporate managers to pursue both higher return on assets (ROA) and higher return on equity (ROE). In addition, major Japanese firms used to rely on unrealized gains on shares as a buffer for the unexpected, and were able to remain profitable on the whole even if substantial losses were incurred in some areas. But, with the stagnant economy and sluggish stock prices, it became difficult to continue to depend on such unrealized gains, and this also seems to be partly responsible for the recent change in attitude of corporate managers who now emphasize rates of return over the short term.

The data show that the ROA of Japanese firms was an average 7.8 percent during the 1980s, but declined to 5.1 percent in the 1990s.1 While this was partly due to the business cycle factor, it is true that the profitability of Japanese firms has been on a declining trend.

Based on ""Financial Statements Statistics of Corporations by Industry, Quarterly"" compiled by the Ministry of Finance.
B. Changes in Economic Growth Mechanisms
One factor behind the declining profitability of Japanese firms is that their balance sheets still carry a huge amount of assets, either idle or underutilized, which is the negative legacy of the bubble period. A second factor is that since Japanese firms have long adopted a management style with an emphasis on maintaining employment, labor's relative share inevitably rose during the long recession, thereby squeezing capital's relative share, which translates into declining profitability. And, a third factor is that as the economy becomes more globalized, those Japanese industries, which had hitherto been protected by various measures such as regulations, are now forced to accept a declining rate of return, leading to the imminent need for large-scale adjustment of their industrial structure.

Given the efforts made by firms, the first two factors may be mended over time. The third factor, however, seems to stem from the substantial and irreversible structural changes that the Japanese economy is currently experiencing.

Let me elucidate on this third factor. Looking at the Japanese economy from a long-term perspective, we observe the following pattern. There is no doubt that the automobile and electronics industries have been one of the engines supporting post-war economic development because of the rapid increase in their productivity. By exposing themselves to international competition from an early stage, these industries have remained at the highest technological level globally and enjoyed high profitability through exports. Wages in these industries were raised in line with increased productivity. And, such an increase in wages permeated to other domestic industries with lower productivity, thereby improving the standard of living for the nation as a whole. If industries with low productivity try to pay the same wage as those with high productivity, the prices of products and services in these industries inevitably have to be raised. The existence of various regulations and traditional business practices have contributed to making such price increases possible without much difficulty.

As the economy became further globalized in the 1990s, the traditional pattern has undergone a tremendous change. What triggered the change was that firms in leading industries have expanded production overseas and conducted operations on a global scale while paying close attention to the difference in costs at home and abroad. As a result, Japanese workers who had enjoyed high wages when compared internationally have become exposed, directly or indirectly, to global competition. In addition, globalized firms which focus on cost performance have pressured their domestic subcontractors and service providers to reduce their prices, thereby threatening the profitability of domestic industries which had not been operating in a competitive environment. Furthermore, with the increase in travel overseas, Japanese consumers have become conscious of the difference between domestic prices and those abroad. These factors, combined with the progress of deregulation, have created a situation where domestic industries which used to be protected from competition find it increasingly difficult to secure profits just by raising prices as they used to do. Thus, the traditional growth mechanism whereby even low productivity industries could maintain a certain level of profitability has apparently become unsustainable.

Since the trend toward globalization is irreversible, it seems that time alone will not resolve this third factor responsible for declining profitability. Hence, it should be regarded as one of the most difficult structural problems facing the Japanese economy. In the U.S., such factors as technological innovation in telecommunications and intensified competition stemming from deregulation are said to have played an important role in improving productivity. Crucial for Japan's economic future is how to raise the productivity of industries which have not operated in a competitive environment. The process of ""creative destruction"" is deemed unavoidable to a certain extent. In this regard, we need to carefully monitor what happens to employment in the process.

VII. Savings and Investment Imbalance and Shortage of Risk Capital
As may have become already clear, keys to restoring dynamism to the Japanese economy are the growth of new industries and firms as well as the simultaneous revitalization of investment. In this context, one might well ask why a country with one of the highest per capita GDP figures in the world and ample household savings totaling 1,300 trillion yen finds it difficult to revitalize domestic investment. This brings us to the third structural problem: the savings and investment imbalance.

A. Decline in Capital Productivity
It is rather ironic that as economic globalization progresses and cross-border capital movements become free, Japan has become an increasingly uncomfortable place for capital to stay because of its high level of capital accumulation. With slow growth in the labor force, Japan has accumulated capital through aggressive fixed investment since the high growth period, which substantially raised the amount of fixed assets per unit of labor. In fact, in the incessant pursuit of economic development since the end of the Second World War, Japan has become a capital rich country, even more so than the U.S.

We should be proud of the fact that, through such capital accumulation, Japan's per capita GDP is among the highest in the world. At the same time, we should be mindful of the fact that the amount of fixed assets necessary to produce the same GDP has been increasing, that is, the productivity of capital has been declining. Declining productivity of capital means that the expected return has been declining, which is consistent with the downward trend of ROA. From an investor's viewpoint, this is the same as saying that capital is not efficiently employed in Japan, which might make investors both at home and abroad hesitate to invest in Japanese companies. Hence, if Japan increases investments only in existing areas to raise labor productivity, it will lead to a further deterioration in capital efficiency. Therefore, Japanese firms are currently facing a difficult challenge to expeditiously dispose of the negative legacy from the bubble period while at the same time exploring new business areas with high profitability and reallocating such resources as capital and labor to them.

B. High Savings Ratio
The imbalance between savings and investment is not a problem stemming exclusively from the investment side. The household savings ratio (on SNA basis) was more than 20 percent in the mid-1970s, but declined to around 10 to 15 percent by the end of the 1980s. The future prediction at that time was generally based on the following life-cycle hypothesis: When Japan becomes an aging society in the 1990s, older generations will reduce their savings and the household savings ratio will further decline, eventually resulting in the disappearance of Japan's huge current account surplus. However, the reality is that the savings ratio stopped declining in the 1990s and the prediction at that time has turned out to be wide of the mark.

It does not seem plausible to argue that a high savings ratio, that is, lower consumption than otherwise, is entirely due to national traits of the Japanese who regard savings a virtue. For example, surveys by the Prime Minister's Office and the Bank of Japan suggest that many older people are concerned about their future livelihood and that they have reduced expenditures because of rising uncertainty regarding the pension and social welfare system. An increase in such uncertainty is also seen among younger generations. People, young and old alike, seem to have been cutting back on expenditures and increasing savings in self-defense to prepare for future uncertainty.

One could say that we are caught in a ""double savings"" situation: In an aging society with a declining birth rate, older generations are saving more from their pensions in preparation for future nursing care needs, while younger generations are actively saving in fear of receiving less from their pensions in the future. Thus, if the household sector considers it necessary to save more and domestic investments are losing attractiveness, the economy will inevitably see an expansion of the fiscal deficit and current account surplus.

To avoid such a situation, it is important to give the public a clear image of the future framework of the pension system so as to reduce uncertainty as well as to establish a social framework for looking after the elderly. In view of the fact that caring for the aged can be a business opportunity in the U.S. and Europe, we should make good use of private sector vitality to create businesses in such areas as social welfare.

C. Shortage of Risk Capital
In addition to the high savings ratio, another marked characteristic of household savings behavior in Japan is the high proportion of savings held in low risk assets such as bank deposits and postal savings. A comparison of the composition of household assets between Japan and the U.S. according to flow of funds accounts statistics shows that: Cash and deposits comprise 55 percent of total assets in Japan, but only 11 percent in the U.S.; and, while the figure for stocks is 7 percent in Japan, it is 43 percent in the U.S. These figures vividly highlight the difference in risk-taking attitude of the household sector between Japan and the U.S. It seems that U.S. capital markets, which tend to promote venture businesses, are supported by such household behavior to no small extent. In Japan, despite the strong propensity for safe assets, it cannot be denied that how to make firms and financial products attractive for investment purposes will warrant study.

I stated earlier that capital productivity in Japan is low and thus not attractive for either domestic or foreign investors. This refers only to the overall trend of the economy thus far. If we closely examine each individual firm and project, there must potentially be many investment opportunities with an appropriate combination of risk and return. There should not be much difference between Japan and abroad in that even a small firm will be able to become a big success if it takes advantage of technological innovation in telecommunications and deregulation. In fact, we may detect some seeds of new business opportunities in the recent buoyancy of the stock market. To germinate such seeds, it is deemed necessary to encourage new entry to the market through deregulation which leads to intensified competition and the revitalization of industries, and to create a variety of financial products through which the abundant savings of the household sector can be smoothly channeled as risk capital to investments in new businesses.

VIII. Concluding Remarks
The Japanese economy now stands at a crossroads as to whether it can move onto a self-sustained recovery path. Needless to say, a stable macroeconomic environment is important for the smooth progress of structural adjustment. We are fully aware that monetary policy is expected to play an important role under such circumstances. With these considerations in mind, we will maintain current monetary easing until deflationary worries subside.

Having said this, the three structural problems discussed here are determined by supply-side factors, and cannot be dealt with only by demand stimulus measures from the monetary and fiscal side. For example, in addressing the corporate balance sheet problem, to what extent firms tackle the allocation of management resources will depend critically on the way corporate governance is being implemented. Regarding the changes in growth mechanisms under globalization, whether new firms emerge to bring innovation to the productivity of existing domestic-oriented industries will depend on how regulations and traditional transaction practices change and how the capital market functions. As to the savings and investment imbalance and the provision of risk capital, much may depend on the future of pension, insurance, and taxation systems.

Since these supply-side measures work on the incentives of firms and households, it thus often takes time for effects to materialize unlike measures working on the demand side.

Even if it takes time, I am not pessimistic about the future of the Japanese economy. We should be proud of Japan's high quality labor force, technology, and managerial ability which enabled the post-war economic recovery. Such economic potential is still intact. I believe that dynamism will be restored to the Japanese economy if, with appropriate supply-side prescriptions, industries revitalize themselves through the transformation of existing firms or the creation of new ones in a competitive framework conducive to increasing risk-taking activity.

In fact, the government has been examining various measures to tackle unemployment and industrial revitalization. And, in the private sector, we can observe some signs of future changes such as the increase in business affiliations and mergers and the review of business areas. By promoting structural change, the Japanese economy will undoubtedly exhibit the potential to transform itself into an economy with vitality and high productivity.

In coming up with specific supply-side prescriptions, cooperation between the private sector and the government is essential in discussing such problems as how to guide incentives for firms and households in a desirable direction and how to minimize moral hazard. I sincerely hope that my speech today will contribute to discussion on the very important problem of structural reform.",,Positive,0.7526627779,,
"Jul. 29, 1999","Excerpt from ""Preparing for the Coming Century,"" a Speech by Sakuya Fujiwara, Deputy Governor of the Bank of Japan, at ""Keizai-kurabu"" on July 29, 1999 (The Safety Net after April 2001)","I would like to talk about the deposit insurance system after April 2001, often referred to as the ""Year 2001 Problem"" or ""Payoff Problem"" in the media. The subject has only started to be discussed on a full scale, and the Bank of Japan does not have concrete proposals on this matter yet. However, I would like to share with you some issues that we have in mind at the moment.

Financial System Problems in Recent Years and Measures to Cope with Them
The present Japanese safety net measures are probably all that can be desired to prevent financial system instability when a bank fails. First, I would like to review how the safety net has been developed.

The Japanese deposit insurance system was established in 1971. At the beginning, the system's sole function was to ""payoff"" deposits, in other words to pay insurance up to a million yen. In 1974, this limit was raised to 3 million yen and then in 1986 to 10 million yen. At the same time, the Deposit Insurance Corporation (DIC) was authorized to make loans or contributions to facilitate mergers and the transfer of business of failed financial institutions. Later, as seen in the examples of the Tokyo Kyowa and Anzen credit cooperatives, in December 1994, the successive failure of small and medium-sized financial institutions materialized because of the bursting of the bubble economy. To cope with the situation, in June 1996, the DIC was authorized to extend ""special financial assistance"" in order to protect deposits and other liabilities in full until the end of March 2001. However, the Japanese financial system encountered a serious crisis when major financial institutions such as Yamaichi Securities and Hokkaido Takushoku Bank failed in November 1997, and the Japan premium jumped in overseas markets. To respond to the worsening situation, in February 1998, the Diet authorized an appropriation totaling 30 trillion yen for the disposal of failed banks and recapitalization of viable banks. Moreover, in October 1998, the Financial Reconstruction Law and the Financial Function Early Strengthening Law were enacted, providing a framework of failure resolution including temporary nationalization and placement under the Financial Reorganization Administrator, as well as a framework for the recapitalization of financial institutions with public funds. The DIC was provided with the necessary financial resources for the full protection of depositors, with public funds allocated for that purpose being doubled to 60 trillion yen. Under this framework, the Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan and the Nippon Credit Bank were placed under state control. And, in March 1999, public funds totaling 7.5 trillion yen were injected into major banks in order to enhance their capital base.

Assessment of the Present Regime and Need for Change
Due to these decisive actions by the authorities and own efforts on the part of individual banks, I believe the uncertainty surrounding the financial system has been fading gradually. In this sense, I consider the measures being taken are necessary and justifiable, if not desirable, with a view to maintaining the stability of the financial system. However, these exceptional measures; especially the one that repays all the liabilities of failed banks, is costly as it is effective taxpayers are the ones who share the this cost. Naturally, this gives rise to moral hazard. That is, financial institutions are not sufficiently monitored by depositors and markets, because it makes no difference which institution they choose if all liabilities are protected. It should be noted that self-responsibility and market discipline are basic principles behind the Big Bang in Japan. Therefore, there seem to exist problems in keeping such emergency measures as protecting all the liabilities of banks for a long time.

Lifting the Moratorium on ""Payoff""
As we near the expiration of the exceptional measures in March 2001, debate on whether or not to lift the moratorium on payoff is drawing public attention. Yet it seems that even those who disagree with the lifting the moratorium do not believe unlimited protection should be permanent. In other words, they are of the view that, when the financial system is extremely unstable, comprehensive protection measures are necessary, and that confidence in the financial system may not be fully restored by March 2001 to allow repeal of the current protection measures. This subject as well as the framework of the future safety net is for the public to decide. However, we believe it most important to make best efforts to restore confidence in the financial system within the remaining one and a half years, making use of the currently available framework. And to make such efforts effective, ""easy prolongation of the exceptional measures"" would not be desirable.

In addition, designing a safety net for after the abolition of exceptional measures is also an important issue. The Financial Council of the Ministry of Finance has been working on this matter, and on July 6th it published an interim paper. The paper itself does not suggest any particular direction for discussion, but simply lists specific issues that need to be thoroughly considered together with conflicting opinions on each issue. The issues are wide ranging, and demand difficult judgments before reaching conclusions. However, since the issue of designing a new safety net concerns all depositors, that is, the whole nation, it is important to make public as soon as possible the outline of the new framework based on wide discussions.

A New Framework of Failed Bank Disposals
Such is the discussion on the new safety net under way. At this stage, there are some points I would like to mention.

First of all, depositors should understand that lifting of the moratorium on ""payoff"" means abolishing the exceptional measures that are applied at present to protect all liabilities. It does not mean that the ""payoff"" or literally liquidating failed banks, is applied in all cases. In fact, in the U.S. and Europe, literal ""payoff"" is considered as the most costly way of disposing of failed banks both socially and economically and is applied only in exceptional cases. Thus, the most frequently used resolution method is the business transfer, where a part or all of the business of the failed bank is transferred to a healthy bank. During this process, depositors and other creditors may be made to share a proportion of the loss.

In this sense, it is necessary to clarify what it means to lift the moratorium on ""payoff"" so that the word should not unnecessarily make people nervous. In fact, this does not necessarily mean that all failed banks disappear after deposit insurance is paid out to depositors. More precisely, it means that, as a result of the abolition of the exceptional measures, the government and the Deposit Insurance Corporation will not assume all losses of the failed banks, and thus depositors and claimants too would share appropriate losses.

The next thing I would like to clarify is that although it is stressed that deposits are protected up to 10 million yen, whether the failed bank is disposed of by ""payoff"" or business transfer, this does not mean that amounts exceeding 10 million yen will be entirely lost.

The phrase ""amounts exceeding 10 million yen will not be protected"" is seemingly causing significant misunderstanding. In reality, amounts exceeding 10 million yen will be repaid on a pro rata basis from recovery of the failed bank's assets through the liquidation process just as in ordinary bankruptcy cases. In addition, the Deposit Insurance Corporation is authorized to make early repayment on the amount of deposits exceeding 10 million yen by purchasing them from the depositors of the failed bank at an estimated liquidation value, and therefore the depositors do not have to wait for the liquidation process to be completed. For example, if the liquidation value is estimated to be 80% of book value, 80% of the amount exceeding 10 million yen will be repaid at an earlier stage. Of course this percentage is a mere example, and it really depends on each case.

Third, the trouble entailed by a bank failure is not limited to the burden on the depositors that deposits are not repaid in full. When a bank fails, the operations of the bank, including acceptance and payment of deposits, would practically be disrupted for a certain period under the present deposit insurance system. Under the present deposit insurance system, insurance is applied per depositor, not per account. That is, when an individual or company has several accounts in the failed bank, balances of all such accounts have to be aggregated to determine the insured amount. This is a very time-consuming process. Moreover, when haircutting the deposits and other claims in proportion to the value of the failed bank's assets, time-consuming procedures, such as obtaining the consent of claimants, are unavoidable. As a result, payment of insurance and liquidation proceeds, in spite of all efforts to be quick, could require a significant period of time. In such circumstances, the depositors of the failed bank will not be able to withdraw their deposits until they receive the advance payment of liquidation proceeds, and the borrowers also have to find another financial institution to fund their business. In the worst case, individuals could be short of funds for living expenses. Unable to meet daily settlement obligations, small businesses could be brought to a standstill for lack of liquidity.

Therefore, one of the most important points concerning the future safety net seems to be how to ensure swift resolution.

As I mentioned earlier, in overseas cases instead of literally wiping out failed banks, it seems necessary to have in place other alternatives which, for example, preserve financial functions needed in local areas. Specifically, it seems necessary to introduce a method where deposits and loans of failed banks are transferred to other sound banks in a prompt manner. Here, promptness is the key.

This is easier said than done. In order to introduce such a method, several complicated legal and practical problems have to be solved. These problems are the major issues being discussed in the Financial Council.

In this sense, the ""P&A"" (purchase and assumption) employed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation of the U.S. may be suggestive. Precisely, P&A means to ""purchase assets and assume liabilities."" In P&A, the failed bank is closed on a Friday after business hours, and over the weekend, deposits are grouped by name, excess claims haircut, and a portion of assets and liabilities transferred to the assuming bank. Such prompt resolution requires preparatory work and the appropriate legal framework. If this method can be introduced in Japan, business operations of the failed bank would not be disrupted on a business day.

I am not saying that our failure resolution method should transplant the U.S. style in every respect. As a matter of fact, legal and practical differences between the U.S. and Japan make it impossible. We just need to make efforts to get over the legal and practical difficulties involved and devise a prompt way to dispose of failed banks while referring to the experiences of other countries such as the U.S.

So far, I have covered various points in relation to the framework of the new safety net. However, what is most important is to prevent banks from failing, and, if a failure does occur, to resolve it at an early stage before the losses become too large. In short, it is desirable to foster sound management of financial institutions so that deposit insurance does not have to be called upon. But, if it has to be utilized, disposals should be made before the cost to the insurance fund becomes too large. Such prompt action will be indispensable in minimizing the cost for the maintenance of financial system stability.

Giving due consideration to these points, we would like to contribute to the work under way to establish a new framework for the future safety net.",,Positive,0.8056009412,,
"Aug. 27, 1999","Remarks by Yutaka Yamaguchi, Deputy Governor of the Bank of Japan, at a symposium sponsored by the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City between August 26 and 28, 1999 (Asset Price and Monetary Policy: Japan's Experience)","1. I would first like to thank Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City for giving me this opportunity. However it is not without pains for me to talk on our so called ""bubble"" years, for it is not yet a part of the past, but it is a part of the present. In fact, much of Japan's difficulties in the 1990s clearly has its origins in the asset market swing in the last 15 years. Its scale has been unprecedented through the modern history of Japan. The damage left on the balance sheet of firms, both financial and non-financial, has been enormous. A question haunts us to this day if monetary policy in the 1980s couldn't have been conducted to help stabilize the asset markets with the effects of leaving less painful adjustment in the 1990s. I will therefore spend most of my time in revisiting our ""bubble"" days.

2. The first alternative course in monetary policy I want to examine is much earlier tightening actions than the BOJ actually took in May 1989.....preemptive policy, if you will. Would it have been reasonable and what might have been the effect on asset price?

The macro-economic environment in the second half of 1980s was unique indeed. The CPI inflation stayed close to zero for three years through 1988, while real growth accelerated to 5% per year from less than 4% in early 1980s. The key elements that supported such no-inflation performance appear to have been:

(1) The lagged effects of 100% appreciation of the yen against the dollar after the Plaza Accord.
(2) The changing labor market structure that helped moderate wage pressure in the face of extremely tight market conditions. Major changes include rising market participation of women, increased dependency on part-timers, shift of labor from self-employed businesses to more modernized, and inflow of foreign workers, among others.
(3) Helped by easy credit and lower capital cost, businesses invested heavily, which in turn generated faster growth in productivity and lower unit labor cost. Growth accounting also suggested faster improvement in total factor productivity.
With hindsight, such excellent performance was unsustainable. The lag between rapid growth and eventual rise in inflation happened to be longer than usual but the linkage didn't disappear. As the state of high growth and near-zero inflation stubbornly persisted, however, it became increasingly difficult to distinguish cyclical upswing and trend/structural shift. The BOJ's warnings on inflation threat came to attract less public heed.

The BOJ was also constrained by the international environment. After the Black Monday crash in 1987, the policy coordination among the G-7 came to be reemphasized to ensure global stability, with by far the heaviest pressure fell on Japan's continuation of monetary relaxation. A perception emerged that Japan's interest rate would stay at historical low. It grew more deeply rooted when, in the summer of 1988, Germany and the U.S. raised the key policy rate and Japan didn't. Japan's inaction was not without reasons, as inflation was almost nil, but was read as expressing our emphasis on international cooperation. A bizarre argument gained strength that Japan as the largest creditor maintain low rate as the cornerstone for global stability and growth. Easy money was also regarded necessary to achieve a national economic goal of the day: reduction of external surplus through growth of domestic demand.

For all these reasons, policymakers felt that, for their actions to gain public support, they would need absolutely solid evidence of inflationary potential building up. When such evidence finally emerged in 1989, they quickly seized the moment to reverse the policy. Inflation picked up but peaked in 1990-91 at mid-3%. On the basis of the inflation track record, I would conclude that preemptive policy to achieve sustained price stability would probably have been desirable but must have been very hard to initiate. Professors Bernanke and Gertler indicated in their simulation results that the BOJ should have raised short term interest rates to 8% in 1988 and even higher in the following years. But all through 1988 inflation was pretty close to zero. I don't see how a central bank can increase interest to 8 or 10% when we don't have inflation at all.

3. Supposing a reversal in monetary policy at earlier timing had been implemented ideally, it would have taken away fractions of growth, resource utilization rate and inflation. It is more difficult to estimate the effects on asset price. Such effects appear to vary depending on specific circumstances. If, for instance, early rate hikes had hit the emerging sense of complacency and kept the public as vigilant as usual on potential risks ahead, the asset market should have responded accordingly. Alternatively, in the context of national confidence already growing strong enough, which might have been Japan's situation in 1988 particularly as Japan's market swiftly overcame the Black Monday shock, early but modest tightening might have invited the people to foster their perception of ""eternally"" sustained non-inflationary growth. In that case, the risk premium would have further fallen to offset the interest rate effect. The net result is uncertain but might possibly have been an escalation of asset price. Therefore I would remain cautious in attempting to make a hasty generalization here on the possible effect on asset price.

4. Attempts to restrain asset price at later stage would face even greater difficulties. In this regard, market reaction following the BOJ tightening is illuminating. The Tokyo stock market shrugged off the first two rate hikes, continued to rise for six more months and started to fall only after the third rate increase. The lag was even longer for the real estate market to peak out. The pattern of implied forward rates indicated the market's conviction that the rising interest rate would be short-lived, presumably for the reasons I have described above.

This episode seems to suggest that, once the asset market gained momentum, it could take more than gentle strikes to break its neck, for monetary policy would have to be adjusted tight enough to match the enhanced state of expectation. A firmly imbedded market expectation of continued low interest rate could take strong actions to be corrected. But, when such expectation begins to change, perceived future risk also begins to grow and the market suddenly starts to fall. A self-feeding process tends to develop between weakening market and increasing risk premium. That is why asset market abruptly collapses when somehow turning point arrives, making ""soft landing"" difficult. In fact Tokyo stock market fell by 40% in one year after the peak; the BOJ's business contacts also confirmed in late 1990 an abrupt shift in the tide in the property market. In other words, if monetary policy targeted on asset price in a situation like Japan of ten years ago, the risk would be that, once the gear is reversed, the combined effects of tight money and asset market correction could well turn out to be a disproportionately large pressure on real activity.

5. I have so far discussed in the Japanese context why it is not feasible to attempt to control asset price. That said, it is also important to identify exactly how monetary policy was associated with Japan's asset ""bubbles"" in the late 1980s, for monetary policy may at least be able to avoid reinforcing the asset market momentum. In view of the important role of expectations in generating on asset ""bubble"", I would cite the following two aspects as having been more relevant than the level of interest rate or monetary growth as such.

First, monetary policy failed to effectively check the permeation of such unrealistic assumption as perpetually low interest rate. Such perception was nurtured through a series of policy actions and inactions from Plaza to Black Monday to German and U.S. rate hike. Stronger emphasis on sustained price stability as policy objective over other considerations, such as exchange rate and external surplus, would have been helpful, and more effective battles with external constraints would have been necessary.

Second, continuous and consistent warning by the BOJ on possible future risks would have been helpful. When a society somehow becomes full of confidence, it tends to grow complacent and negligent of risks ahead. Japan in the second half of 1980s was likely approaching that kind of stage, as it had just overcome the 100% appreciation of the yen with high manufacturing technology. Against that background, several years of above-trend growth and near-zero inflation probably induced a significant drop of risk premium. Thus the discount rate adjusted for risk premium, a key determinant in the asset price equation, must have declined markedly. Obviously the BOJ alone was not able to deal with the tide of national sentiment, but it appears nonetheless important for the central bank to have tried to ""lean against the wind"" and endeavor to keep the public alert on potential risks.

6. The last point on the Japanese episode is the vast accumulation of risk in the real estate market. One feature of the financial development in the 1980s was that, when broad money growth moderately accelerated in the second half to 10% per year from 8% in the first half, property-related bank loans increased by 20% annually. It is this credit concentration that produced the real estate ""bubble"" and left behind lingering balance sheet damages.

Behind such an acceleration in bank lending was the erosion of bank franchise value. The prospect of financial liberalization accentuated the bank's search for new market opportunities. Large borrowers were increasingly turning to the capital market, but the gradualist and sagmentation approach of liberalization effectively prevented bank entry into the lucrative security or investment banking businesses. Property lending was a quick way to make profit, acquire market share in small and medium sized firms with secure collateral...or so it seemed. At the initial stage the property market was probably moving on a solid ground as the abundant liquidity with low rates attracted an influx of foreign players and demand for new offices sharply rose. But the process evolved into a self-feeding cycle between credit expansion and rising property value.

My colleagues at the BOJ has found a few years ago that a simple ""stress testing"" incorporating a common-sense assumption...that land price-to-GDP ratio, which sharply rose in the late 1980s, return to the historical trend value...yields a rough estimate of what turned out to be the reality of bank assets in the 1990s. But one would truly have to ""lean against the wind"" to exploit such stress test results, for disregarding the historical pattern is the very nature of a ""bubble"". Furthermore, even if such results had been available, it is an open question what monetary policy could have done on the basis of the property market development alone. Obviously risk concentration can develop in other areas. When it does, it may fall, like Japan's case, in the nexus of monetary and prudential policies. I strongly feel that we need to make further progress in this area. Central bankers can play a constructive role supplementing risk management at private institutions and prudential regulations.

In reexamining the policy issues in the 1980s, I have benefited a great deal from discussions with Masaaki Shirakawa, Kunio Okina, Hideo Hayakawa and Masayoshi Amamiya of the Bank of Japan.",,Negative,0.4863416255,,
"Oct. 8, 1999","Remarks by Yutaka Yamaguchi, Deputy Governor of the Bank of Japan, before Colloque Monetaire International at Banque de France, October 8-9, 1999 (Monetary Policy and Structural Policy: A Japanese Perspective)","Introduction
The topic for this session--""The Policy Mix and the Structural Policies""--stimulates our thoughts because it is a challenge facing many if not all central banks in both developed and developing countries, and to which we have not found definitive responses yet. I do hope, therefore, to take home some new insights through our discussions today. Meanwhile, this is a bittersweet subject for me, because, looking back with a 20/20 hindsight, the 1990's in Japan can be characterized as a decade during which disproportionate burden was placed on monetary and fiscal policies, while the speed of executing essential structural policies or adjustments in the Japanese economy or financial system was slow. Under such circumstances, the Bank of Japan had to conduct its monetary policy with one eye to the actual pressures on the economy and another eye towards traditional central bank policy philosophies--a decade in which best possible monetary policy was pursued under constraints imposed by structural problems. In the following minutes made available to me, I would like to give my account of what it was like to be ""in the circle"" during the 1990's: the constraints facing the Bank of Japan and the Bank's choices thereunder. This would be my contribution to the discussions in this session.

2.The Monetary Policy of the Bank of Japan during the 1990's
The path towards zero-interest rate policy
Let me start by describing the state of the Japanese financial markets today.

As you probably all know, the Bank of Japan has been driving down money market rates since July 1991, after the ""bubble economy"" came to an end. The overnight money rate, which was over 8% at its peak, was driven down. Our Bank decided this February to allow interbank interest rates to fall as far as possible (to practically zero), and subsequently announced in April that ""zero interest rates"" would be maintained until concerns over deflation would subside. Consequently, interest rates in Japan are at historic lows: beginning with the overnight rate at 0.03%, the two-month interbank rate is 0.04%, one year TB's are selling at 0.04% and long term rates are below 2%. Meanwhile, the Bank has actively discharged its responsibility to maintain the stability of the Japanese financial system, as regards its ""lender of the last resort"" functions, which is as important a policy tool of a central bank as the setting of interest rates. In addition to the more conventional liquidity support in crises, as outlined most eloquently by Bagehot, the Bank provided support in the form of equity in a few cases. Furthermore, not only deposit-taking institutions but, in one case, a nonbank, Yamaichi Securities, received the Bank of Japan's liquidity support.

The adoption of ""zero interest rate policy"" and the active exercise of its lender of the last resort functions beyond the traditional bounds would suggest that the Bank of Japan during the 1990's was an ""outlier"" in terms of policies adopted by central banks. Having said this, however, I should also point out that the more traditional concept of central bank functions as described in Bagehot's classic, Lombard Street, was a reflection of the unique conditions that existed in Great Britain towards the end of the last century. Accordingly, the choices made by the Bank of Japan in monetary and financial stability policies should be judged in the context of the conditions that existed in Japan during the 1990's. I would like to discuss this aspect over the next few minutes, concentrating on monetary policy as embodied in interest rate policy, but occasionally touching upon the lender of the last resort functions.

Through the decisive lowering of interest rates, what did the Bank of Japan achieve and what did it not?

What the Bank of Japan did achieve was preventing the Japanese economy from falling into deflation. In the light of a classic yardstick for identifying deflation--the general decline in price levels of goods and services, and contraction in money and credit--the Japanese economy has, if only barely, escaped deflation. To underscore this point, let me compare the present state of the Japanese economy, in terms of prices, money supply and GDP, with the U.S. economy in the 1930's, at the height of the Great Depression. With the first quarter of 1991 for Japan and the first quarter of 1929 for the United States as the benchmark, consumer prices in Depression era United States declined to a low of 74% whereas they are still standing at 107% in Japan, i.e., without any marked decline. Money supply in the United States bottomed out at 65% but it remains at 124% in Japan. A contrasting trend is also observable in GDP: 67% in the United States to 109% in Japan.

Looking from the other side of the coin, so to speak, the low interest rate policy adopted by the Bank of Japan only succeeded in maintaining the levels of prices and money supply. As I noted a few moments ago, the level of money supply is now 124% of what it was at the end of first quarter of 1991 at the peak of the ""bubble economy,"" but, looking at how this money is created through the assets of deposit-taking financial institutions, we see that claims on the public sector, including the purchase of government bonds has increased to 126%, whereas claims on the private sector remain virtually flat at 107% at the end of July this year. Real GDP has barely grown, an annual rate of 1%, during the eight years since the collapse of the bubble. If I may refer also to fiscal policy, according to the latest OECD forecasts, the general government surplus of 2.9% of nominal GDP in 1991 is expected to deteriorate to a 8.7% deficit in 1999, but this massive deficit spending was only sufficient for maintaining the levels of economic activity, not turning it around onto a growth path. Of course, Japanese monetary and fiscal policies is still in full swing towards restoring Japan to a sustainable growth path, and it is too early to make a definite assessment.

3.The Effects of ""Structural Problems""
Recent developments in the Japanese economy that I have just described raise a question. Why has macroeconomic policy--the drastic reduction in interest rates and increases in government spending--failed to reflate the Japanese economy? The shorthand answer is probably that there existed tremendous structural problems that could not be overcome by measures aimed at boosting aggregate demand in the short run.

Economic growth is a constant process of adapting to changes. Changes could be technological innovations. Changes in the relative prices of goods, services and factors of production could also initiate this process. Whatever the initial change, firms would attempt to adapt to the new environment and maximize profits. New products could be developed, production and distribution could be overhauled, or the management of the firm could be transformed. This is the essence of the process of ""creative destruction"" that is the driving force of economic growth. Economic growth in the medium to long term is, according to basic textbooks in economics, determined by inputs of factors of production such as labor and capital, and by increases in productivity. Of these elements, from the perspective of individual firms, it should be safe to say that increases in productivity are governed by firms' ability to adapt to changes. If so, the quest into why the Japanese economy stagnated during the 1990's would become a search for the reasons why the capacity to adapt was impaired. The stagnation of the Japanese economy in the 1990's could be attributed to the interactions between the declining ability to adapt to changes by Japanese firms and globalization, which was effecting critical changes in the economic environment.

Structural factors at play
Why had Japanese firms taken so long in adapting to changes? Let me offer three factors that are most relevant to monetary policy.

First and foremost was the drag on economic activity resulting from non-performing assets. In other words, the erosion of capital at firms weakened the overall resiliency of the economy. For example, as banks' capital base was eroded, banks became less inclined to take on new risks. In case of non-financial firms, i.e., the borrowers, the want of capital prevented them from effectively adapting to changes through new investments and research and development. As a result, the growth in bank credit slowed considerably.

The second factor I would like to point out was the delay in improving economic infrastructure in the broadest sense--laws, regulations, taxes, etc. Global business opportunities offered by the revolutionary progress in information and communications technology were forfeited as existing infrastructure became strictures on innovations that could have exploited such opportunities.

The third point was the Japanese corporate culture, in particular concerning employment and corporate governance. In the case of the employment system, the Japanese system based on so-called ""lifetime employment"" featured the accumulation of firm-specific human capital on the side of employees. This was once regarded as the source of competitive advantage of Japanese firms, but might have hindered labor mobility from declining industries to ascendant industries and/or from inefficient firms to efficient firms, which is essential if an economy is to overcome a major structural adjustment. As to corporate governance, board members comprised mostly of corporate insiders and cross-holding of shares used to be regarded as a virtue of Japan Inc., because such a system was deemed to enable management to focus on medium to long term strategies. The other side of the coin is that it shields management from market pressures to improve the return on capital.

Though I do not wish to sound too fatalistic, these three factors I have just noted are ""preconditions"" to monetary policy, and in that sense ""structural."" If I may repeat myself, non-performing assets hindered the ability of firms to adapt to changes by discouraging risk-taking by firms. Outdated economic infrastructure deterred innovations even if firms had the will to take on risk. Employment practices and poor corporate governance dampened the motivation of management to effect the necessary changes.

The globalization of the economy and the financial system
Of course, there are arguments against such a view stressing structural influences. Critics point out that Japan had long lagged behind in improving economic infrastructure. They also argue that Japanese corporate culture, such as employment and governance mechanisms, had not changed and was, in fact, deemed the source of strength for the Japanese economy in the 1980's. I do not dispute that such arguments have a grain of truth in them. If an economy could sustain robust growth for some time under a certain established economic mechanism or system, it should be presumed that such a mechanism or system was adopted rationally. Japanese practices concerning employment and corporate governance were, at least until quite recently, probably constituted a rational mechanism or system to sustain robust growth for a few decades. Nevertheless, it must also be recognized that when the economic environment changes significantly, systems and practices that used to be rational could become, at least temporarily, constraints on economic growth.

During the 1990's, in addition to the changing pattern of the division of labor between Japan and its Asian neighbors and a rapidly aging population, the most significant changes in the economic environment were advances in information and communications technology, and the resulting globalization and integration of the world economy and financial markets. Under such environment, firms are confronted with ever stronger competition in the global marketplace. The lines that we have taken for granted between manufacturing and service industries, or that between tradable and non-tradable goods are quickly becoming thinner and thinner as information and communications technology advances by leaps and bounds. In this regard, recent developments in Japan are symbolic in that the services industry, which was heretofore been shielded from international competition, is experiencing a more acute adjustment process.

Having said this, I should also point out that systems and practices are not set in stone, so to speak. They would change, however gradually, under pressures from the changing environment. For example, according to economic historians, lifetime employment, which is now closely associated with major Japanese corporations, was not widely adopted until the 1920's. I believe, therefore, that constraints on economic growth from existing systems and practices are temporary, until the economy adapts to the new environment. In other words, it would be too pessimistic to say that the Japanese economy could not be reflated until Japanese employment practices and corporate governance are reformed. What is important is to keep our heads up and carry on with the necessary structural reforms.

4.Monetary Policy and Structural Adjustment
Now that I have given you an overview of the structural dislocations behind the economic stagnation in Japan, I would like to turn to the issue of structural adjustment and monetary policy: how should a central bank conduct its monetary policy in such an environment? Furthermore, if we name policies that address structural factors ""structural policies,"" what are the relations between such policies and monetary policy?

The most important contribution that monetary policy can make is to maintain price stability: i.e., ensuring that the economy does not fall into inflation or deflation. It is solely under such an economic environment that economic agents can accurately discern the changes in relative prices and efficiently adapt to structural changes. Looking back, in Japan in the late 1980's, we saw extensive investments that would only be profitable if the bubble had not burst. Such investments, be they buildings or factories, are still standing, but they are now economically worthless. The huge dynamic resource misallocation is still haunting the Japanese economy. I should also note that such effects of large fluctuations in prices are similar between asset prices and prices of goods and services.

The second role of monetary policy is to mitigate the adjustment pressures on the economy by lowering interest rates, when structural factors are acting as strong head winds. One example of such a policy effect was observed in the United States in the early 1990's: the Federal Reserve's decision to lower the short term interest rates (the Federal Funds rate) led to wider spreads between long and short term interest rates, which acted as an earnings buffer to support the restructuring of financial institutions. Nevertheless, in order for such a policy decision to bring about the desired results, structural adjustment--in the case of the United States in the early 1990's, the restructuring of financial institutions and a redefinition of their business strategies--must be carried out in earnest. Monetary policy can only ""buy time,"" so to speak, in such circumstances. This was why the Bank of Japan had in its recent policy statements stressed the importance of structural adjustment. For example, when the official discount rate was lowered to 0.5% in September 1995, the Policy Board issued a statement stressing that such monetary easing would only be effective if it was accompanied by structural policies such as deregulation.

My third point is corollary to the point I have just mentioned, and is actually what we should not expect of monetary policy: monetary policy cannot replace the necessary structural policies or adjustments. The decisive monetary easing and active interventions to support the financial system by the Bank of Japan no doubt averted deflation or financial panic in Japan. On the other hand, those policy decisions might have dampened the restructuring efforts at Japanese financial institutions. They had also hidden the gravity of the situation from the general public, which resulted in the feeble support for legislative initiatives and budget outlays in response to bank failures. This was a big dilemma for the Bank of Japan. A central bank must avoid first and foremost the economy from falling into a deflationary spiral, no matter how structural policies and adjustments are lagging behind. The result of the monetary easing of the Bank of Japan might have been a Pyrrhic victory: we have succeeded in avoiding deflation but the mitigation of immediate risks resulted in the delaying of adopting ultimate solutions. We must closely examine if this was indeed so in the coming years.

Unfortunately, this most obvious fact that monetary policy cannot replace structural policy seems to be understood only in the abstract. We often hear arguments that call for monetary policy actions in lieu of structural policies under clever disguises. For example, economists both inside and outside Japan often call on the Bank of Japan to increase the purchase of Japanese Government Bonds in the market or begin buying from the Government directly and monetize government debt. Before making such recommendations to pump liquidity into the market, I wish that the advocates would observe closely what is actually happening in the Japanese money market. Under the zero interest rate policy, we are conducting open market operations almost daily to provide reserves, but we often receive bids for funds which fall short of our targets. It should also be noted that much of the funds in the interbank market are remaining in the accounts of money market brokers at the Bank of Japan. This indicates that the liquidity needs of deposit-taking institutions are more than satisfied, and that the shortage of liquidity in the form of central bank reserves is not a constraint on the growth of the Japanese economy.

Inflation targeting is another popular recommendation. I believe that our Bank is fully aware of the pros and cons of such a proposal in conducting monetary policy. The question is whether it would be an effective policy tool under the present circumstances in Japan. The first issue is whether the Bank of Japan can ever guide the expected rate of inflation to a stable and desirable level by mere announcements. The second point is that in relation to what Japan needs at this moment-- returning Japan to a sustainable growth path--whether inflation targeting is an effective tool or not. The driving force behind sustainable growth is, obviously, expenditure that is determined by expectations consistent with the growth rate. If we recognize that consumption is a function of expected future income streams, it is evident that a central bank announcement would not be able to increase consumption because it should have little effect on consumers' expectations on future income streams. Even if consumption were accelerated because of an increase in the expected rate of inflation, it would be a one-off event, not having any lasting effects. What the Japanese economy needs is not an artificial increase in expected rates of inflation but an improvement in the expected rates of economic growth.

5.How to Accelerate Structural Adjustment?
If monetary policy cannot substitute for structural policy, what can be done to accelerate structural adjustment? Let me offer two impressions.

The first concerns adjustment pressures exerted by globalizing markets. The balance sheet problem at Japanese banks is a good example. One of the factors that prompted the implementation of necessary measures to resolve the problem, such as injection of public money and defining procedures to dispose of failed institutions, was, unfortunately, the pressure from the global marketplace, such as the increase in funding costs of Japanese financial institutions as evident in the ""Japan premium,"" and the concerns over the availability of foreign currency funding. If a market neglects to review existing regulations and adapt market infrastructure accordingly in the light of the changing environment--advances in technology in particular--such a market is likely to drop out of global competition. Japanese employment practices are also changing as evidenced by an increasing acceptance of foreign firms as employers, and not many workers, even in large corporations, expect lifetime employment to be maintained in the coming years. Finally, the cross-holding of shares is on the decline reflecting the heightened pressures from shareholders to increase profitability, and, as foreign investors hold more shares of Japanese corporations, we are observing remarkable changes in the valuation of individual corporations. Globalization, as I have noted earlier in this session, is on the one hand highlights structural problems, but on the other hand it embodies mechanisms for structural adjustments as well.

My second impression and final words for today involves what authorities should do when confronted with structural dislocations. Under such circumstances, the public sector must clearly spell out what the issues are and offer possible solutions as a matter of public policy. This is easier said than done. Looking back, much time was needed before the public at large understood the macroeconomic implications of structural problems, such as non-performing loans on the balance sheets of banks, and before accepting necessary measures to resolve such problems. We must also consider that frictions between market-based solutions and long-established social systems and structures are on the rise, in the context of the increasing pressures from the global marketplace. As I noted at the beginning, there is no right answer concerning appropriate structural policy. Having said this, it should be stressed that the ability to address issues, i.e., identifying structural issues, developing concrete solutions thereof, and taking prompt actions, is becoming more and more important. I believe that we are now in the age where states compete as regards such ability to address issues. Central banks' monetary policy cannot replace structural policy. Nevertheless, looking back on the experiences of the Bank of Japan during the 1990's, I believe that central banks are counted on to determine quickly any major structural changes in economies, analyze accurately their implications, and explain them persuasively to the public at large.

I am honored to be invited to this conference today and to be given the opportunity to speak to this panel of distinguished guests. Recent comments and criticisms regarding monetary policy underline the need as well as the importance of giving due account of our policy implementation. Allow me to take this opportunity to share with you our thinking on current monetary policy.

The principles underlying the new Bank of Japan Law enacted in April last year are independence and transparency. Naturally, the independence of monetary policy must be underpinned by accountability. In this regard, we should make continuous efforts in explaining our thinking on monetary policy, on whatever occasions available, in easy-to-understand terms, so as to gain the understanding of the public. Obviously, we should above all endeavor to implement appropriate policies to produce good results to enhance our credibility. I hope that my speech today will add to these efforts.

II. Zero Interest Rate Policy
Zero interest rate policy and ""quantitative easing""
For the past several months, there has been wide ranging and active discussion of the so-called zero interest rate policy. As some elements of the historically unprecedented zero interest rate policy seem difficult to understand, such discussion has sometimes become unnecessarily complicated and the points of contention blurred. Bearing this in mind, I will first discuss our zero interest rate policy.

A good starting point is an oft-asked question why the Bank of Japan doesn't effect monetary easing by increasing the quantity of money rather than by lowering the interest rate. The current directive of the Policy Board with respect to money market operations is simply to ""encourage the uncollateralized overnight call rate to move as low as possible."" There are no specific targets regarding money supply or monetary base. However, as is the same in the market for goods and services, the quantity supplied and prices are closely related in the money market. Interest rates, which are the price of money, can be reduced or maintained at a low level only to the extent that the increase in funds supplied would warrant. The zero interest rate policy is a policy that supplies sufficient funds to keep the short-term interest rate at zero percent.

Let me describe this in operational terms. The statutory reserve for financial institutions which takes the form of deposits with the Bank of Japan and is called the required reserve, is currently a little less than 4 trillion yen. The Bank has been providing about 1 trillion yen in excess of this required reserve so as to maintain the overnight call rate at virtually zero percent.

Such fund provision has greatly enhanced liquidity in the short-term money market and we have seen several phenomena evidencing how abundantly funds have been provided. For example, some 70 percent of the 1 trillion yen excess funds provided by the Bank has accumulated in the accounts at the Bank of Japan of money market brokers, who have, in principle, no need to hold such idle balances. This shows that financial institutions are no longer worried about their liquidity positions and that their motive for holding excess reserves is diminishing.

Another phenomenon is that since this summer we have often observed under-subscription in our money market operations. That is, when the Bank of Japan offers funds in its market operations, the bids from financial institutions do not reach the offered amount, and thus under-subscription occurs. Even though the Bank of Japan attempts to provide ample funds at almost a zero interest rate, financial institutions no longer need the full amount.

Let me draw your attention to the fact that these money market conditions indicate that significant quantitative easing has already been achieved.

Among the various ideas regarding quantitative easing, there is a view that the central bank should set a target on a particular quantitative indicator and conduct monetary policy so as to meet that target. In my view, putting aside technical difficulties, such quantitative targeting entails the following problem. When the financial system faces a crisis and has to resort to massive public funds support, it would be very difficult to control the quantitative indicator to a predetermined level. Even if the central bank were able to control it, there would be no guarantee that stability would be restored to the market and the economy. Take for example monetary base as a quantitative indicator. Monetary base outstanding is some 60 trillion yen, 90 percent of which is the cash and the remaining 10 percent reserves of financial institutions at the Bank of Japan. The growth of monetary base was slightly less than 10 percent last year and has decelerated to about 6 percent this year until now. In the meantime, economic growth was negative last year and the government forecast of 0.5 percent for this fiscal year will most likely be achieved. As such, monetary base and economic growth have shown opposite movements. The movement of monetary base thus evidences a diminishing incentive on the part of the public to hold cash as financial system uncertainty subsides, and hence does not contradict the improvement in economic growth. It is generally known that when an economy is susceptible to financial shocks, including a financial system crisis, financial conditions can better be gauged by interest rates rather than quantity.

However, a zero interest rate policy has more profound significance when it permeates to interest rates on term instruments. When the interest rate on financial assets such as short-term government bills (TBs and FBs) becomes zero, these assets can no longer be regarded as different from cash. In other words, since short-term interest rates became virtually zero this spring, we have witnessed an increase in financial assets which are highly substitutable with cash. This can be interpreted that quantitative easing has progressed substantially. Needless to say, this does not mean that liquidity is available to all borrowers, and the central bank itself is not in such a position as to guarantee the full availability of liquidity to all borrowers. I will come back to this issue later, but for now I would like to point out the importance of grasping the actual state of the financial market as I just described in discussing ""quantitative easing.""

Zero interest rate policy and interest rates on term instruments
There are some who argue that a further increase in fund provision by the Bank could lower the interest rates on longer term instruments of say, 3 months and 6 months.

The interest rates on term instruments are determined by how long the current abundant provision of funds will last rather than by how abundantly funds are provided. The time framework is more important than quantity, which is underpinned by the expectations theory of interest rate determination. The interest rates on term instruments basically reflect the market projection of future short-term interest rates. For example, the one-year interest rate is determined by the market projection of how the overnight interest rate will move over one year from now. And, since the central bank must be flexible so that it will always be able to respond appropriately to any changes in the market, it is impossible for it to announce that interest rates will never change over a certain period regardless of developments in the economy and prices.

Instead of specifically announcing for how long it will continue the ample provision of funds, the Bank has stated that the prerequisite for lifting the zero interest rate policy is not until deflationary concerns subside. Such announcement is intended to give support to the formation of market expectations regarding continuity of the zero interest rate policy. At every Monetary Policy Meeting, deflationary concerns are discussed and the resulting evaluation is presented in the Monthly Report of Recent Economic and Financial Developments and the Minutes of Monetary Policy Meetings.

As a consequence of these announcements, interest rates on term instruments have, in fact, declined to an extremely low level. For example, the rate on short-term government bills is around 0.04 percent to 0.05 percent for the maturity of 3 months through one year, while interbank interest rates are slightly higher reflecting a risk premium. The decline in short-term interest rates is surely acting as an anchor for medium- to long-term interest rates. Thus, a combination of the zero interest rate policy and the announcement that it will continue until deflationary concerns subside has been quite effective in seeing that the effects of monetary easing permeate through to the yield curve as a whole.

III. Zero Interest Rate Policy and Economic Activity
Effects of zero interest rate policy
From last autumn to the beginning of this year, liquidity concerns in the market became extremely serious due to financial system turbulence in addition to stagnant economic activity. The zero interest rate policy, through the ample provision of funds, nurtured a sense of relief among market participants because they knew that funds could be obtained whenever necessary, thus effectively dispelling concerns over liquidity. In addition, the policy has permeated smoothly to medium- to long-term interest rates, helping to bolster corporate and household confidence through favorable effects on stock prices and other asset prices.

Economic activity has gradually been exhibiting some signs of recovery. Aggregate demand led by public works and housing investment has improved, and production has begun to pick up partly thanks to an increase in exports. However, private consumption is still stagnant and business investment on a declining trend. Thus, we have yet to see an autonomous recovery of private demand.

Despite the continuation of the zero interest rate policy, why is private demand so slow to recover? Some argue that monetary easing is not enough. However, in view of the ample provision of funds to the market as I described, the background to the recent situation does not appear so simple as to justify the belief that monetary easing has been insufficient.

Let me elaborate on this from the viewpoint of the relationship between monetary easing and economic activity.

Monetary easing and economic activity
In general, monetary easing or a decline in interest rates permeates the economy through effects on the supply side, that is, bank lending, and also on the demand side, in other words, corporate funding activity. The effects of monetary easing and the development of money supply are determined by the interaction between the supply of, and demand for, funds.

For example, broadly speaking, there are three factors which affect bank lending activity. First, whether there are any uncertainties over the funding cost and the quantity to be raised. Second, whether banks are duly equipped to undertake the financial intermediary function, namely to take risks. And third, whether there is enough demand for bank loans.

The zero interest rate policy has greatly contributed to alleviating concerns over liquidity by lowering the cost as well as providing ample funds. In fact, since this spring, tightness in funding has substantially receded not only among financial institutions but also among firms.

Even though liquidity constraints are resolved, the effects of monetary easing will not be able to permeate the economy as a supporting force for recovery if the other two factors remain as constraints.

Let me comment on the second point, the financial intermediary function. It might be safe to say that the extremely cautious lending stance of financial institutions once observed has largely retreated due to steady progress in the disposal of non-performing assets and the injection of public funds to recapitalize major banks at the end of March. According to various surveys, including our Tankan Survey, the lending stance of financial institutions has gradually shifted toward being easy since this spring. Not only the resolution of liquidity constraints but also the improvement in the capital position of banks has contributed to such a shift. In addition, financial consolidation has advanced faster than expected, as witnessed by the recent announcements of a big merger and alliance among financial institutions. If the reallocation of managerial resources proceeds parallel with the disposal of non-performing assets under more competitive market conditions, the financial intermediary function will be firmly strengthened throughout the entire financial system.

At present, the non-performing asset problem has yet to be totally resolved. Financial institutions are still working to strengthen their capital positions by improving soundness and profitability over the medium term. While such financial consolidation is expected to steadily progress, it may well take some time before it has a positive impact on the financial intermediary function.

How about the third factor, the demand for bank loans? This relates to what extent firms will conduct forward-looking activities, especially business investment. In this regard, the environment surrounding business investment has gradually improved as witnessed by the recent signs of recovery in production, exports, and corporate profits. However, the bursting of the bubble has left a lasting scar on the corporate sector in the form of excess capacity and excess debt. Therefore, we have not seen any significant moves by firms to borrow money for investment purposes. Rather, there seems to be an increasing tendency for financial restructuring. If cash flows improve even slightly, firms will use the funds to repay debt. In addition, the need to set aside emergency funds seems to have decreased reflecting diminished anxiety over the financial system, but which only encourages firms to repay debt.

Given such observations, we have seen some counter-intuitive and paradoxical developments regarding money supply. Here I am thinking of the fact that while liquidity constraints have been resolved thanks to the permeation of the effects of monetary easing and improvement of corporate profits, the resolution of such constraints has itself contained an increase in money supply, albeit temporarily.

In this connection, there are proposals suggesting that the Bank directly provide funds to the corporate sector. This appears to reflect some misunderstanding because the counterparties of the Bank's market operations are not limited to financial institutions. The Bank conducts its operations in the so-called ""open"" market where there is a wide range of participants, including securities companies and money market brokers. For example, since securities companies procure the financial assets eligible for the Bank's operations through their customer network, the funds created by Bank operations will also flow to the customers of banks and securities companies.

For the further permeation of the effects of monetary easing, it is important to examine the range of private liabilities that the Bank accepts as eligible for its lending and money market operations. The Bank currently designates a variety of private liabilities as eligible, including bills, loans on deeds, CP, and corporate bonds, all of which must satisfy certain credit standards. These standards are essential in maintaining the soundness of the central bank's assets, which are one of the foundations supporting the country's credit standing. The central bank should never purchase liabilities that fall short of its credit standards.

Of course, we must constantly review, in line with changes in financial transactions, the type and scope of financial assets that can be accepted as eligible in return for the Bank's credit. Such review is also important for the central bank to enhance its operational capability. From such a viewpoint, the Bank has taken various measures. This spring, it introduced new market operations utilizing corporate bonds and loans on deeds as collateral. And in September, it announced the policy of including asset-backed securities satisfying certain conditions as eligible collateral for the Bank's operations.

With a view to the recent market environment where the under-subscription of money market operations is seen from time to time, we decided on October 13 to introduce the outright purchase and sale operations of short-term government bills and to expand the range of government bonds for repurchase operations. We will make full use of these newly introduced measures to assure further permeation of the effects of zero interest rate policy.

A credit multiplier is the ratio of money supply generated to the liquidity provided by the central bank. As the term implies, if the power to generate credit is weak in the private sector, the positive effects of monetary easing will not materialize even if the central bank provides ample liquidity. What generates such credit is the risk-taking capacity of financial institutions and firms. To enhance this capacity, steady efforts should be made to promote structural reform in such areas as strengthening the financial system and increasing the innovative power of firms through deregulation. At the same time, I hope financial institutions will develop credit analysis methods that are suitable for a new economic environment, and explore and nurture firms with high growth potential that do not yet have sufficient collateral.

IV. Current Monetary Policy Management
Thinking behind current monetary policy management
Let me next explain the Bank's new measures decided at the Monetary Policy Meeting on October 13.

The following two factors were taken into account.

First, the effects of the yen's recent appreciation on the economy. The 15 percent appreciation against the US dollar between July and September of this year was quite rapid.

At this juncture, let me explain our thinking regarding the relationship between monetary policy and the exchange rate since it seems we have not been able to make it completely clear so far.

In examining this issue, two important points should be borne in mind. First, the Bank should act appropriately and timely by paying due attention to developments in the economy as well as financial markets, including the foreign exchange market, since the exchange rate has various effects on economic activity and prices. Second, it is not appropriate for the Bank of Japan to conduct monetary policy with the objective of guiding the exchange rate to a specific level.

Though the Bank has repeatedly emphasized both of these points, it is unfortunate that somehow attention only focused on the second point, which led to the view that the Bank would not take heed of the exchange rate. To repeat, the exchange rate is an important factor to be considered in the conduct of monetary policy and the effects of its fluctuations are naturally incorporated in our assessment of the economy and financial markets, which forms the basis of our policy management.

From such a viewpoint, the effects of the recent appreciation of the yen warrant careful attention. The effects of changes in the exchange rate on the economy need to be judged not only in light of the exchange rate itself, but in combination with other factors. For example, one factor behind the recent appreciation of the yen is the upward re-evaluation of Japan's economy by the market reflecting the economy having stopped deteriorating and some positive signs emerging. The unexpectedly smooth recovery of Asian economies has also had a favorable impact on Japan's exports and production, which appears to have been strongly recognized as an improvement in the environment surrounding Japan's economy.

We are not yet in a position to conclude that a sustainable recovery is underway in view of the fact that business investment is declining and a recovery of private consumption has yet to be seen. Under such conditions, we consider it necessary to carefully monitor how the appreciation of the yen affects the economy. While it puts downward pressure on prices, we have observed other factors containing a price decline such as the rise in international commodity prices, including crude oil, and the progress of inventory adjustments.

The second important factor regarding the decision on October 13 was that, induced by Year 2000 problems, it is likely that precautionary demand for funds will increase toward the end of the year, putting upward pressure on interest rates. Year 2000 problems are generally regarded as occurring at the beginning of the new year, but the truth of the matter is that pressure in financial markets will emerge much earlier. If firms and financial institutions want to hold ample funds for any emergency and try to avoid settlement around the beginning of the new year, upward pressure on current interest rates would be seen. In addition, the demand for funds peaks in December due to such factors as bonuses and year-end sales. Year 2000 problems tend to aggravate the situation. In fact, 3-month interest rates which go over the year-end have already become somewhat higher. If such development results in a substantial increase in interest rates as a whole, there is the risk that the effects of the zero interest rate policy might be negated.

Under such circumstances, it is necessary to adjust the conduct of monetary policy so that financial markets remain as calm as possible. The Bank needs to be sufficiently prepared in case there is a substantial increase in the demand for funds. If credibility regarding the Bank's preparations prevails, upward pressure on interest rates will be contained to some extent.

Further permeation of the effects of monetary easing and flexible response
Based on the aforementioned two factors, the Policy Board held discussions on September 21 and October 13, and reached the conclusion that the most important task under the current zero interest rate policy was to ensure, without interruption, further permeation of the effects of monetary easing.

To this end, we decided to take some measures. First, with respect to daily market operations, we articulated our stance to maintain the zero interest rate policy by flexibly providing ample funds. We also announced our readiness to respond flexibly in addressing Year 2000 problems, for example by providing ample funds over the year end. Second, in addition to such fund provision on the macro level, we announced that we would respond in a timely and appropriate manner through our lending facility should an individual financial institution experience a temporary liquidity shortage. Third, to strengthen our policy response, we decided to enhance our operational measures by introducing outright operations using short-term government securities.

Let me elaborate on the meaning of the flexible provision of funds.

The Bank of Japan has been providing about 1 trillion yen in excess of the reserve required by financial institutions. Since this excess amount of 1 trillion yen has been observed in the market for some time, some argue that the Bank's operations have become less flexible. The Bank does not regard maintenance of this amount as an objective or a rule. As has been repeatedly stated, the current directive for money market operations is to maintain the unsecured overnight call rate at virtually zero percent. The necessary and sufficient amount of funds provided to fulfill this directive has been consistent with an excess of some 1 trillion yen over the required reserve for the past several months.

Put differently, the Bank is ready to flexibly provide funds depending on the state of the market. In fact, around September 9 when the market focused on the possibility of computers malfunctioning and from the end of September to the beginning of October when the demand for funds related to the interim closing of accounts increased, the Bank provided more than 2 trillion yen excess funds to prevent the call rate from rising. Current operational measures possess flexibility to promptly respond to changing market conditions. The decision regarding operational measures on October 13 reinforced such flexibility.

For the immediate future toward the year-end, there might arise upward pressure on market rates. In addition, we must always be vigilant as to whether substantial changes in asset prices such as the exchange rate, long-term interest rates, and stock prices might affect the financial market. The Bank of Japan will flexibly respond as needed if there is any anxiety that turmoil might spread to the financial market.

Dialogue with the market
Lastly, I would like to touch upon the issue of communication between the central bank and the market. This is in response to the frequently heard criticism that the decision on September 21 to go against market expectations was a mistake, and which resulted in the yen's appreciation and stock price plunge.

When considering our response to market expectations, we face two difficult issues.

First is how to preserve the price formation mechanism. For example, if the central bank begins reacting to short-term market expectations, there is the possibility that the market will come to place an overly strong emphasis on the reaction of the central bank, which runs the risk of distorting the price formation mechanism that is supposed to evaluate economic fundamentals. ""Dialogue between the central bank and the market"" is an oft-cited phrase. I understand this is the process of checking each other's thinking based on a solid analysis of current economic conditions and the outlook. Should such a process deviate from checking economic fundamentals and turn into a guessing game of ""who wants what,"" there is a risk that overshooting and misalignment might ensue.

The second issue is that it is extremely difficult to find a truly effective policy response that works on people's psychology. In some cases, it may at first appear that the policy has been effective, but the effect will diminish as the market regains calm. In other cases, policy announcement or implementation may have a significant impact when the market is temporarily paralyzed by large external shocks or when market expectations swing to one side. In the end, the Bank should make a decision based on thorough examination of the objectives and effects of its policy measures and the situation at hand.

To have constructive dialogue between the central bank and the market, it is important that the Bank's thinking on monetary policy and its evaluation of economic conditions is shared by market participants. To this end, the Bank must explain its thinking on monetary policy in easy-to-understand terms and in a consistent manner. The Bank also needs to produce good results in its policy implementation, which will enhance its credibility.

V. In Closing
Today I have explained our thinking on recent monetary policy from various aspects.

Let me reiterate that the Bank of Japan will continue its zero interest rate policy until deflationary concerns subside and make efforts to ensure further permeation of the effects of such a policy. Under this policy, we will flexibly provide ample funds.

In relation to ""flexibility,"" let me comment briefly on the time framework effect of our zero interest rate policy. Should concerns over the future economic outlook and prices emerge, the market would expect that the timing for lifting the zero interest rate policy would be deferred. If the market incorporates such an expectation, medium- to long-term interest rates will decline more rapidly. When the yen appreciated rapidly in September and the market perceived that the appreciation had gone too far, long-term interest rates actually dropped. The financial market intrinsically has an automatic adjustment mechanism. A combination of the zero interest rate policy and our announced commitment to its continuation, in my view, has a positive effect in maximizing such an adjustment mechanism.

Here I would add that it is not realistic to think that all problems relating to the financial system and structural reform, such as reorganization of the industrial structure in the context of a globalized world, can be solved by monetary policy alone.

Looking back on the eight years since the collapse of the bubble, Japan's economy has faced recurrent deflationary pressure as well as pressure for structural adjustment. The Bank faced the dilemma that while monetary policy alone could not solve structural problems, and at times it might even delay structural adjustment, it had to make a policy response as long as pressure for structural adjustment exerted a deflationary impact on the economy. These thoughts finally led to the adoption of the zero interest rate policy.

Let me close by saying that the Bank of Japan will continue to firmly support the Japanese economy from the monetary side so that some positive signs now being observed in the economy will, this time, lead to a self-sustained recovery. At the same time, we strongly hope that structural reform such as the restructuring of corporate management and the strengthening of the financial system will bear fruit and lay the foundation for renewed development of the Japanese economy.

Thank you for your kind attention.

"Oct. 20, 1999","Remarks by Kazuo Ueda, Member of the Policy Board of the Bank of Japan, at the Fed Conference on 'Monetary Policy in a Low-Inflation Environment,' in Woodstock, Vermont on October 20, 1999","I would like to start by congratulating the organizers of this conference for having been very successfully forward-looking. Zero interest rates have become a reality if in a small part of the world. I regret that I have not been forward-looking enough. By first having accepted the invitation to attend this conference and then having driven rates down to zero, I put myself in a very difficult position.

Anyway, let me start by spending a few moments discussing what we have been doing since last year. When I joined the Board in April last year, the overnight call rate was already slightly below 0.5 percent--not a good time to join a central bank. Since then we have cut it down successively to zero, more precisely 0.01 percent for lenders and 0.02 percent or above for borrowers. The overnight rate came down to these minimum levels toward the end of March. This was already a very extreme monetary policy stance, and we had gone to the extreme using a traditional tool, i.e., the overnight rate. I must say that we needed a lot of courage to go to the zero rate.

In April, we went further in a fairly non-traditional way. That is, our governor said we would stick to the zero rate policy until deflationary concerns were over. This commitment, we think, delivers something very close to what inflation targeting or quantitative targeting might offer, to the extent that you believe that monetary policy works through interest rates. Or, we could say that this has been like us writing a put option on short-term assets. Yet another way of explaining our position could be the following: by the commitment to maintain the zero rate for quite some time to come, we have tried to minimize uncertainties about future short-term rates, thereby decreasing the option value of long-term bonds, hence putting negative pressure on long-term interest rates. With this announcement, market interest rates came down sharply again. As of last week, three-month and one-year TBs were traded at 0.045 percent and 0.035 percent, respectively.

Do we need any further action? Obviously, it depends on where you think the economy is. After growing at negative rates for five consecutive quarters, real GDP grew at surprisingly high rates in the first two quarters of this year. We were worried that this turnaround could be short-lived because the stimulus from fiscal policy was expected to peter out later this year. However, the news we have been getting for the 3rd and 4th quarters have been encouraging. For example, the index of industrial production is expected to stay fairly strong in the second half of the year, up about 3 percent over last year. Furthermore, we are now pretty much sure that the fiscal stimulus will continue well into the next year.

Prices have stopped falling. CPI is almost unchanged relative to last year. Changes in other indexes like domestic WPI are still negative relative to last year, but are either zero or slightly positive relative to three months ago.

Offsetting this, the appreciation of the yen may exert some negative impacts on the economy in the near future. Serious corporate restructuring efforts are underway, dampening the response of investment or consumption to the expected rise in sales and profits. So, all in all deflationary concerns have not abated. That is why we have not changed our policy stance.

Assessment of the current state of the Japanese economy is certainly not the topic of the conference. But I felt that there is some misunderstanding that Japan is in the midst of a serious deflation, which is why I spent a few minutes on the question.

Now let me briefly touch upon an academic, not a real-world question of what a central bank can do beyond zero rates if it ever wanted to ease from that point on. Of course, my comments will be necessarily motivated by what I have seen in the Japanese economy during the last few months.

To begin with, back to reality for the moment. The current policy stance of the BOJ has an automatic stabilizer element in it despite the fact that we have hit the zero rate bound. That is to say, the promise to ""keep the zero rate until deflationary concerns are over"" puts downward pressure on long-term interest rates when people see negative signs about the economy, because they expect the zero rate to stay for a longer period of time. A similar thing would happen under many circumstances. But the current commitment seems to have strengthened the effect.

Let me now come back to academic exercises. I have not digested all of the suggestions made so far in this conference. So, let me comment on a subset of them. First, there was the idea of creating negative nominal interest rates. Second, quantity of money may matter even without changes in interest rates. Third, purchases of non-traditional assets may work through their effects on the prices of these assets.

Starting with negative rates. This is an interesting idea. But imposing a tax on banknotes seems to require some technological improvements at least. It will take time. So, it may be useful for the Fed or the ECB, but not for the BOJ. The most serious problem with this proposal, however, seems to be the effort it takes to educate the public about the meaning and necessity of negative rates on currency.

Second, let me move on to discussing money supply effects on the economy other than through interest rates. I must say they are very small once liquidity has been injected enough to maintain the zero rate. McCallum's simulation seems to support such an intuition. I hasten to add that, once the zero rate is reached and spreads over to most of the short-term interest rates, attempts to expand the money supply themselves may become unsuccessful. We have been experiencing this lately in Japan.

Hence, suggestions have been made to go beyond traditional tools of operations. The list is very long: long-term government bonds, stocks, consumer durables, real estate, foreign exchanges, and so on. There are at least two reasons for buying these assets: the purchase may reduce the external finance premium; and it may change the prices of these assets. Of course, the two mechanisms are interrelated. On the external finance premium question, I think the effects on the premium of central bank purchase of bonds would be small in a country like Japan, where the majority of bonds are held by financial institutions. Thanks to the zero rate policy among others, they are not paying high premiums nor liquidity-constrained. The story would be different if a central bank started buying stocks, or real estate.

Whether central banks can systematically affect the prices of these assets is an old question to which no one has a satisfactory answer. Let us for the moment assume that they can. Then, surely central bank purchase of at least some of these assets will affect the economy.

Just a few words on central bank purchase of foreign exchanges. Sorry to come back to the Japanese example so often, but I just wanted to note that the BOJ cannot do this because it is prohibited from buying dollars in an attempt to influence the exchange rate. The MOF can, of course, do it, and we are in no way against their doing it at appropriate timing.

There remains the question of whether intervention should be sterilized or not. As many have pointed out in this conference, sterilized and unsterilized interventions are theoretically equivalent under zero interest rates unless one wants to rely on probably non-rational market expectation that the two are different.

As a footnote to the discussion of buying non-traditional assets, I might point out that the BOJ has expanded the menu of instruments in a rather unusual way. Now we use or plan to use commercial paper, corporate bonds and asset-backed securities, but in a disciplined way. That is, we do not buy them outright but under repurchase agreements, or we use them as collateral for other operations. This way the instruments are used to supplement our operations in the money market, and the double-name principle is strictly applied. Of course, the purpose of the operations has been, in addition to providing funds in the money market as a whole, to increase the liquidity of the markets for the instruments so that the effect of money injection would have a larger impact on the economy.

Going back to outright purchases of non-traditional assets, I must say that they generate various types of costs for the central bank and for the economy, some of which we may not be aware of and most of which are not explicitly dealt with in formal models economists use. These costs certainly ought to be weighed against possible benefits of the operations before any decision is made. I hope we will not be the one to make such a risky decision.

I promise, however, to bring all the interesting ideas I have heard in this conference to the attention of my colleagues in Tokyo. Meanwhile, I must say that one of the most important messages of the conference has been: do not put yourself into the position of zero rates. I tell you it will be a lot more painful than you can possibly imagine. Thank you.",Part 1,Neutral,0.8077136874,,
"Nov. 1, 1999","Speech given by Nobuyuki Nakahara, Member of the Policy Board of the Bank of Japan, at the Capital Markets Research Institute in Tokyo on November 1, 1999 (Current Economic Conditions in Japan and Challenges for Monetary Policy)"," Introduction
It is a great honor to have been invited to speak to such a distinguished group of experts from the banking and securities industries. I would like to take this opportunity to give my personal view on the following topics: developments in monetary policy since April 1998; the current state of the Japanese economy; and the downside of the zero interest rate policy. I will also explain my proposal put forward at Monetary Policy Meetings to set targets for the monetary base and the inflation rate. I will give an overall review of these topics, and hope that I will not sound overly self-righteous.

II. A Chronology of Monetary Policy Meetings since the Bank of Japan Law of 1997 Came into Effect
First, I would like to talk about developments in monetary policy since April 1998 and issues discussed at Monetary Policy Meetings in chronological order. I would like to make clear my opinions put forward at the meetings, taking care not to breach the code of confidentiality. This is a summary and personal reflection on the implementation of monetary policy since the new Bank of Japan Law came into effect in April 1998. My conclusion is that there is still room for additional monetary policy measures, even in the current environment of zero interest rates, and that one of the possible measures is to set targets for increases in the monetary base and the general price level.

I would like to draw your attention to Monetary Policy Meetings since April 1998. These 18 months can be divided into four periods in view of the decisions made at the meetings. The first was from April to September 9, 1998, when the target for the uncollateralized overnight call rate was lowered to 0.25 percent. The second was the period from September 9 to November 13, 1998, when the policy board decided to facilitate corporate financing by expanding the Bank's CP operations, establish a temporary lending facility, and study the feasibility of a new operation using corporate debt obligations as eligible collateral. The third was the period from November 13, 1998, to February 25, 1999. At the February 12 meeting, the guideline for money market operations was changed, leading to the adoption on February 25, 1999, of the so-called zero interest rate policy. The fourth was the period from February 25, 1999, to today. At the September 21 and October 13 meetings, no changes were made to monetary policy.

A. Assessment of the Economy as of April 1998
At a press conference on April 1, 1998, when I was inaugurated as a Policy Board member, I gave the following assessment of the economy. First, the economy was in an extremely severe situation due partly to restrictive fiscal measures. The public came under a burden totaling nine trillion yen as a result of a these fiscal measures, i.e., the abolition of special tax cuts worth two trillion yen, an increase in the consumption tax which amounted to five trillion yen, and a rise in medical and other charges amounting to two trillion yen. Second, business fixed investment was in a cyclical phase of decline. Third, the international competitiveness of Japanese firms was declining as a result of excessive capacity and labor. Improving the efficiency of capital was therefore an urgent task, and it was clear that corporate restructuring would be crucial over the next several years. Lastly, if the economy were to worsen, monetary policy would need to be eased further.

At that time, the economy was in a declining phase from a cyclical perspective, with real GDP falling for three consecutive quarters on a quarter-on-quarter basis from the October-December quarter of 1997. This, combined with insufficient economic policy measures and a degeneration of the financial system's credibility due to problems such as banks' nonperforming loans, made it extremely difficult to foresee economic developments.

B. The Run-Up to the Rate Cut on September 9, 1998
Against this background, I started proposing from the June 12 Policy Board Meeting that the uncollateralized call rate be guided to a lower level. The Policy Board's directive for the Bank's money market operations at that time was to ""encourage the uncollateralized overnight call rate to remain on average slightly below the official discount rate."" I proposed that monetary policy be eased further by gradually guiding the uncollateralized overnight call rate even lower. I proposed the following target rates: 0.40 percent at the June 12 and 25 meetings, 0.35 percent at the July 16 and 28 meetings, and 0.25 percent at the August 11 meeting. All of these proposals were voted down. The debate at those meetings was centered on (1) a perception gap regarding the future of the economy--the other members were not as pessimistic as I was about the outlook, and (2) a difference of opinion with regard to how to react to the government's economic measures--whether to wait and watch the effects of the measures or whether to quickly implement monetary measures in view of the severe state of the economy. Let me expand on this. For example, at the July 28 meeting, one member expressed the view that ""the risk of a double-dip decline in the economy involving a further substantial drop in production had been reduced."" Even at the August 11 meeting, just before monetary policy was eased, some members expressed the opinion that ""for the time being it was most important to keep a close watch on the contents and effects of the large-scale fiscal package covering fiscal 1998 and fiscal 1999, as the details of the package were gradually becoming apparent."" My opinion was quite different. Many of the other Policy Board members took a mildly optimistic view of the situation, and were inclined to take a wait-and-see stance with regard to fiscal policy and its effects. In contrast, I stressed the necessity of further monetary policy easing in light of (1) slumping business fixed investment and deteriorating employment conditions, (2) the fact that the state of the economy was even worse than in September 1995, when monetary policy had last been eased, and (3) the unstable movements in the stock markets of Tokyo and New York. Finally on September 9, the target for the uncollateralized overnight call rate was lowered to around 0.25 percent. I recall that, at the beginning of that meeting, some members seemed a bit hesitant about further monetary easing. However, at the end of the meeting, nearly all of the members voted to lower the uncollateralized overnight call rate, overturning the decision reached at the previous Monetary Policy Meeting. Personally, I regret the fact that a preemptive step--a rate cut at an earlier stage--based on the Bank's internal economic forecasts was not taken.

C. From September 9 to November 13, 1998
The second critical moment was the November 13 meeting. As a result of discussion at this meeting, the following were decided and announced to facilitate increasingly severe corporate financing conditions over the end of the year and over the end of the fiscal year. First, the Bank would make active use of CP operations with repurchase agreements and, to this end, would expand the range of CP eligible for operations under repurchase agreements to include those with remaining maturities of up to one year (previously restricted to up to three months), and also expedite the process of CP eligibility evaluation. Second, as soon as necessary arrangements had been made, the Bank would establish a temporary lending facility to refinance a fixed proportion (50 percent) of the increase in loans provided by each financial institution during October-December. Third, the Bank would start a new market operation utilizing corporate bonds and other debt obligations as collateral. At the previous Monetary Policy Meeting on October 28, I had proposed that the Bank indicate clearly in the directive its intention to make active use of CP operations. This proposal was defeated at the October 28 meeting, but won majority support at the November 13 meeting. On November 13, I opposed the proposals to create the temporary lending facility and start market operations utilizing corporate bonds and other debt obligations as collateral. I was concerned that people might think the introduction of the temporary ""lending"" facility would pave the way for the revival of a lending facility previously used as a market operation, which was criticized as being too discretionary and was later abolished. My opposition to launching the new scheme utilizing corporate bonds and other debt obligations, which was to be installed as a permanent policy tool, was based on concern over the Bank expanding its operations into corporate financing, which is conducted essentially by private financial institutions. I believe the Bank should basically conduct monetary operations utilizing government securities, like the Federal Reserve System. If the Bank plays a role in corporate financing, it should limit such activities to its traditional operations of rediscounting commercial bills or market operations utilizing CP, which have relatively short maturities. I basically think that the Bank should not readily expand its role in corporate financing. Purely for your information, outstanding loans extended under the temporary lending facility in fact peaked at only 1,035.6 billion yen, partly owing to factors such as developments in interest rates during the period concerned.

A development worthy of special mention occurred before the November 13 meeting. On October 9, the Nikkei 225 Stock Average fell sharply below 14,309.41 yen--the low of August 18, 1992--to 12,879.97 yen, its lowest level since the bursting of the economic ""bubble."" Some Policy Board members had earlier repeatedly argued that an interest rate cut should be saved for emergencies such as a dramatic fall in stock prices or an intensification of deflation. However, when the emergency became a reality, no steps were taken to change monetary policy. I believe this risk of inaction still remains. For example, some members have said that quantitative easing should be implemented should the yen surge dramatically. I doubt, however, that such timely action will be taken.

D. From November 13, 1998 to the Start of the Zero Interest Rate Policy
After that, seeing that the economy was showing no signs of a turn for the better, I started proposing from the meeting on November 27, 1998 that the overnight call rate be lowered even further. At the November 27 meeting, I proposed the uncollateralized overnight call rate be lowered to 0.15 percent; on December 15, 1998 and January 19, 1999, I proposed a rate of 0.10 percent; and on February 12, I proposed that the Bank conduct quantitative easing (expand the monetary base) by maintaining the uncollateralized overnight call rate at as low a rate as possible. I stressed that this move was aimed at ""quantitative easing"" and included it specifically in my proposal because room for a further reduction in the interest rate was extremely limited. My proposal was defeated, and the chairman's proposal for the Bank to ""provide more ample funds and encourage the uncollateralized overnight call rate to move as low as possible....initially aim to guide the above call rate to move around 0.15 percent, and subsequently induce further decline in view of the market developments"" was adopted. I believe this proposal was approved because a perception was growing that downside risks were increasing due to pressures stemming from rising long-term interest rates and the stronger yen. I voted for the chairman's proposal because it included my contention that emphasis should be put on quantitative easing. However, the overnight call rate did not fall below 0.12 percent despite comments by Governor Hayami at a press conference on February 16 that the Bank did not rule out the possibility of zero interest rates. Therefore, at the February 25 meeting, I expressed my concern that the easing might not be effective, and urged that efforts to push the rate down be accelerated. In response to the situation, the Bank's operation unit started boosting its injection of funds into the money market in late February so that its projection of the daily excess of reserves, which is announced each morning and affected in part by the Bank's market operations, totaled 1.3 trillion to 1.8 trillion yen. As a result, the stock market suddenly started showing signs of a recovery in early March, and interest rates gradually fell close to zero. The zero interest rate policy is still in effect today. Looking back at developments in monetary policy since April 1998, I believe the monetary easing on February 25 was the most effective, largely because of its quantitative character; it substantially increased the projected daily excess of reserves. This quantitative easing had a positive effect on the stock, bond, and foreign exchange markets, and helped improve the confidence of market participants. Since the February 25 meeting, I have proposed the Bank set targets for the monetary base and the inflation rate. I will go into detail on this later.

E. The Meeting on September 21, 1999 and Recent Developments
I would like to touch last upon the September 21 meeting. At the time of this meeting, the yen--which had broken through 110 yen and was appreciating--was a focal point. However, many members of the Policy Board appeared to be surprisingly complacent about the impact of the rapid rise in the yen. I have spent most of my career in the oil industry, which is extremely sensitive to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. My experience there has taught me that the difference in the effect on businesses with the yen staying at 120 yen to the dollar and breaking a resistance level at 108 yen is significant. Therefore, it was my opinion that preemptive action should be taken. I also believed market intervention should be unsterilized, if the markets were expected to react favorably to such a decision. At the September 21 meeting, as the minutes show, members generally shared the view that ""a little more time was needed to judge the degree of the downside risk to the economy arising from the recent appreciation of the yen."" My understanding is that most members were inclined to take a wait-and-see stance. I warned them that financial markets, not only the foreign exchange market, but also the Tokyo and New York stock markets, were at an extremely critical juncture, thus, grave consequences might ensue if appropriate action was not taken. On September 21, the Policy Board by majority vote decided to leave monetary policy unchanged. On the same day, the Bank issued a statement ""On the Current Monetary Policy,"" and the chairman of the Policy Board explained at a press conference the thinking behind the belief that ""additional fund provision"" would not be effective. I was against issuing the statement. Members who supported the idea of issuing such a statement probably did so either because they thought financial markets were misinterpreting monetary policy and therefore should be informed of the Bank's true intentions, or because they were becoming concerned about financial markets not moving in the direction the Board members wanted them to. With the exception of when changes are made in monetary policy, I believe that the best way to explain the Bank's position is for the chairman of the Policy Board to give a detailed explanation at press conferences. I fear the issuing of the statement may well bind the Bank's future actions.

At the October 13 meeting, the Policy Board decided to start operations involving outright buying and selling of short-term Japanese government securities and announced an expansion of the scope of government bonds eligible for repo operations, both with a view to strengthening money market operations. I believe these two measures will contribute to the further improvement of money market operations.

III. The Current State of the Economy
Now let me give my view of the Japanese economy.

Since the bursting of the enormous economic ""bubble,"" the Japanese economy has been heavily weighed down by the burden of excessive capacity, labor, and debt. Business fixed investment has slumped by an unprecedented degree, and the unemployment rate has hit record highs. The Japanese economy remains mired in an extremely unusual phase.

To sum up my view of the current state of the economy, I believe it is highly likely the economy hit bottom around April or May this year judging from the indices of business conditions for July and August. However, this development can be ascribed largely to policy measures. Although the economy appears to be heading in the right direction, the momentum of the recovery is extremely weak and vulnerable. As for the outlook for next fiscal year onwards, there are hardly any signs of the economy returning to a self-sustaining recovery. Taking these factors into consideration, I believe that preemptive action--a further monetary easing--should be taken in conjunction with the implementation of fiscal policy.

I would now like to talk about the economy from the perspective of economic cycles. According to an analytic method devised by U.S. economist Michael Boldin, which uses the composite index of business conditions, it could be said that if the coincident composite index of business conditions for September, due to be announced on November 4, is above 97.5, the economy hit a trough in May. The CIBCR method shows that a trough was hit during March to June, and the diffusion index shows that a trough was hit in July. In conclusion, I believe it is highly likely that the economy hit a trough around April to May.

These analyses point to a strong possibility that the economy is heading toward a recovery. However, the economy is still very unstable and fragile, and a slight adverse development could depress it because of the following four factors. First, it is unlikely that further positive effects will emerge from policy measures and external factors. Policy measures--including an increase in public investment, a reduction in housing taxes, an expansion of the credit guarantee system, and monetary easing--have, together with external factors such as a recovery in other Asian economies, just managed to support the economy up till now. Second, it is still hard to envisage a self-sustaining recovery in domestic demand such as business fixed investment and private consumption. Third, the problem of excessive capacity, labor, and debt--a legacy of the bubble economy--has not been resolved. Corporate restructuring is approaching a critical stage in eliminating the three ""excesses."" And fourth, growth in monetary aggregates such as money stock and the monetary base is slowing, and this, through the appreciation of the yen and other factors, could have a negative effect on the economy.

I am extremely concerned about the course of the economy from next fiscal year onward. Recently, the government started compiling a second supplementary budget, and plans to keep the next fiscal year's public investment at this fiscal year's levels, but I think this will probably be difficult to accomplish. The economy will therefore have to increasingly rely on private demand. Unfortunately, a number of negative factors have emerged for Japan's exports, which have been relatively firm up to now: the real effective exchange rate of the yen has risen by a monthly average of more than four percent from July to September, the sharpest rate of rise since the United States abandoned dollar-gold convertibility in 1971; and the financial sectors of some other Asian countries are in the midst of restructuring and their exports hinge on the trend of those to the United States, which is unforeseeable. With regard to private consumption, employees' income is falling as a result of the deterioration in employment conditions due to corporate restructuring and cuts in wages and salaries per hour. Hopes are pegged on an improvement in households' propensity to consume, but I believe such an improvement will be limited. Moreover, in business fixed investment, any turn for the better is likely to be from the second half of fiscal 2000 at the earliest owing to the excess in capacity. It is still too early to draw a scenario of a self-sustaining recovery led by private demand. I also fear that land prices may not bottom out for some while, and we need to be aware of the fact that this may delay corporate restructuring and cause financial institutions' nonperforming assets to increase.

As for financial markets, as I said earlier, the foreign exchange market and stock markets in Tokyo and New York have just passed through a critical period, and at present, stocks in the United States appear to have entered an unstable phase while the rebound in Tokyo stocks has been feeble. In the foreign exchange market, the yen appears to be gathering upward momentum.

Thus, various aspects of the Japanese economy remain extremely vulnerable, and it is necessary to secure an economic recovery by preemptive monetary easing synchronized with fiscal policy, bearing in mind Article 4 of the Bank of Japan Law.

There are many formulae to calculate the deflationary gap; the one giving the largest gap--in the most severe case--produced a figure of eight to ten percent of GDP. The inflation rate is zero or slightly below zero, and I therefore believe there is no doubting the need for further monetary easing. Moreover, with the effects of the zero interest rate policy appearing to have waned, I believe it would be advantageous to change the monetary policy regime by introducing targets for the monetary base and the inflation rate.

",Part 2,Positive,0.9001895189,,
"Nov. 1, 1999","Speech given by Nobuyuki Nakahara, Member of the Policy Board of the Bank of Japan, at the Capital Markets Research Institute in Tokyo on November 1, 1999 (Current Economic Conditions in Japan and Challenges for Monetary Policy)","The Downside of the Zero Interest Rate Policy
Next, I would like to talk about the problems of the zero interest rate policy in this unusual economic environment.

A. The Problems of Implementing the Zero Interest Rate Policy
Based on my understanding, the following can be said of the zero interest rate policy: (1) the policy targets solely an interest rate and does not aim at a quantitative easing with a concrete numerical target; (2) the effects of the policy seem to have dissipated between March and the present; (3) the objectives of the policy are abstract and unclear; (4) the policy has exposed the inconsistency of the technical methods used by the Bank of Japan in money market operations; and (5) the policy is symbolic and does not allow further action--the only options are to continue it or to stop it. Furthermore, ending it will give rise to various problems.

To expand on the first point, the zero interest rate policy targets only the uncollateralized overnight call rate; it does not target an increase in reserves or monetary aggregates. It differs clearly from quantitative easing that sets a target for monetary aggregates such as the monetary base. Under the zero interest rate policy, ample funds will be provided so that the interest rate falls to zero. However, the logic of the policy implies that, after the zero interest rate is attained, there is no need to supply additional funds. Moreover, with the current money market operations, the provision of funds to achieve a daily excess of one trillion yen in reserves is deemed necessary and sufficient, except for when firms need to procure funds for the end of their business terms. Therefore the provision of funds is not increased, and additional positive effects of quantitative easing are unlikely. If the Bank, in the current zero interest rate environment, conducts market operations so that the daily excess of reserves significantly exceeds one trillion yen, a quantitative target should be set and such a decision should be made by the Policy Board.

The second point reflects my view that the effects of the zero interest rate policy have dissipated since March. Although the phrase ""further permeation of the zero interest rate policy"" is reiterated, the foreign exchange, stock, and bond markets, which react instantaneously, are unlikely to show further positive response and the likelihood of a favorable impact on the real economy, via low interest rates stimulating business fixed investment, is remote.

On the third point, this policy is abstract and many difficult phrases are used to explain it. Such expressions as ""abundant and flexible provision of funds"" and ""provision of ample funds"" mean only necessary and sufficient funds will be provided purely for the purpose of pushing the overnight call rate to zero, and thus additional increases in the provision of funds cannot be expected after the rate reaches zero. The phrase ""(the zero interest rate policy) will be continued until deflationary concerns are dispelled,"" does not make clear whether the deflationary concerns are mainly related to developments in prices or in the economy. If they are related to the economy, it should be made clear which indicators are being watched, how long the policy will be continued, and what conditions need to be satisfied to end the policy. For the public, all of these are unclear. Of course, if the public is happy with the overall judgement by the Policy Board based on various indicators, that is fine, but I do not think that is necessarily the case. Furthermore, on price stability--an objective of the Bank--I personally believe the Bank should stop using abstract phrases, such as ""a situation that is neither inflationary nor deflationary"" to describe price stability. The Bank, to ensure its accountability, should set a concrete numerical target in its policy.

My fourth point is that the zero interest rate policy has exposed the technical problems of the Bank's money market operations. These are evident in the large discrepancy between (1) the Bank's projection of the daily excess of reserves made at 9:20 a.m. on weekdays--which market participants interpret as a quantitative signal, and (2) the actual amount of the excess at the end of the day. Before the zero interest rate policy was implemented, the gap between the projection and the result was not that significant. For example, the monthly average of the daily projection for January was an excess of 180 billion yen (this figure and those which follow have been rounded to the nearest 10 billion yen) while the actual amount was 140 billion yen, and in February the projection was an excess of 320 billion yen against an actual 270 billion yen. In March, just after the introduction of the zero interest rate policy, the projection was for 1,540 billion yen but the actual excess was 900 billion yen lower at 640 billion yen. In April, the projection was 1,300 billion yen and the actual excess 180 billion yen; in May the figures were 1,080 billion yen and 330 billion yen. The discrepancy between the forecast and the actual result has thus sometimes been of the order of one trillion yen. In September, the projection was an excess of 1,100 billion yen and the actual result was 190 billion yen, a difference of almost one trillion yen. Furthermore, in September, of six of the 20 business days, actual reserves fell below the amount of ""remaining required reserves"" (the daily average of reserves that should be deposited in the remaining days of the reserve maintenance period). That is, for almost one third of the business days in September, the Bank tried to create an excess of reserves through its market operations, only to find that funds did not flow to institutions that are required to hold reserves and as a result the amount of remaining required reserves did not decrease. This discrepancy between the projection and the outcome can be attributed to the fact that (1) the forecast for the supply and demand of funds in the money market, which is used to calculate the projection of the daily excess of reserves, is always very different from the actual result, and (2) the formula used to calculate the projection of the daily excess of reserves is based on the assumption that, as in the past, there will be no excess reserves at the end of a reserve maintenance period. Considering the meanings of the words ""forecast"" and ""projection,"" I think it inappropriate for the Bank to announce ""forecasts"" for funds demand and supply and ""projections"" of reserves that deviate greatly from the actual results. The words ""forecast"" and ""projection"" should be used only when they are likely to be relatively accurate, otherwise the Bank's accountability is at stake. If the Bank has no plans to immediately adopt quantitative easing, the Bank should change the term ""projection"" of the daily excess of reserves or the formula used to calculate the amount as soon as possible in favor of a more accurate term or formula. Moreover, the injection of funds into the money market, which should be adjusted carefully in line with market conditions, has been fixed to achieve a daily excess of reserves of about one trillion yen, and the amount has become a psuedo target. It is my opinion that the current policy framework is not working properly, and therefore, the Policy Board should decide a target for excess reserves or the monetary base, present this to financial markets, and change the policy stance to attain this target. In this case, I do not think the Bank necessarily needs to use the concept of the daily excess of reserves.

As I said earlier, the forecast and results of funds supply and demand differ greatly. On a monthly average, the disparity for January this year was 70 billion yen and for February 80 billion yen. After the introduction of the zero interest rate policy, the disparity grew to 680 billion yen for March, 930 billion yen for April, and since then, the gap has ranged from several hundreds of billion yen to one trillion yen. The reason for this large gap is that the forecast for funds demand and supply is based on the assumption that funds held by institutions that are not required to hold reserves at the Bank--such as money market brokers-cum-dealers called tanshi companies--will flow to financial institutions that need to hold reserves. However, in reality, funds do not flow in that direction, and remain in the hands of such institutions as tanshi companies. The Bank's forecast of funds supply and demand from ""others"" (included in the item ""Net fiscal payment and others"") has recently been almost always below the actual result because ""others"" includes the flow of funds from such institutions as tanshi companies. If the Bank is to continue to release its forecast for funds supply and demand, I think the breakdown of the flow of funds, e.g., the flow to/from tanshi companies, should be made clear so that market participants get an accurate idea of market conditions.

I am also worried about the fact that some signs of moral hazard are emerging, i.e., some money market participants appear to be depending on the Bank's current policy. The Bank announces its daily forecast for the demand and supply of funds and its projection for the daily excess in reserves, and therefore, money market participants need not bother to analyze or forecast the market's funds demand and supply themselves. Some participants are said to base their outlook for interest rates entirely on the Bank's quantitative signal, i.e., the projection for the daily excess of reserves. I have been told that, for the past few months, as soon as the Bank announces its projection at 9:20 a.m. of an excess of one trillion yen in reserves, some market participants stop watching the market for the rest of the day and that they think all they need to do is to seek help from the Bank if they encounter problems. If this situation continues, the money market will cease to function properly, and will not be able to respond instantaneously to various factors that affect the market.

My fifth point is that the zero interest rate policy is not a policy that sets a numerical target for interest rates or monetary aggregates, and a further easing of policy is impossible. This policy is symbolic and does not allow further action--the only options are to continue it or to stop it. One cannot implement a slight easing or tightening, i.e., flexible adjustments to policy are impossible. In other words, it can be said that the most crucial point of the policy is how long it remains in place. If expectations grow that the policy will be ended, there will be a large impact on the bond market. In the case of monetary base targeting, which I will explain later, the degree of monetary easing is indicated by specific figures, therefore it cannot give rise to the above concerns.

If the Bank is aware of the time element of the zero interest rate policy, it should use concrete figures to make clear the economic environment it is aiming for, or forecasting, and the timeframe to achieve that goal. An example would be the United Kingdom, which aims to achieve inflation of 2.5 percent at a two-year horizon. What the Bank needs to do when an unexpected development changes the course of the Japanese economy is to adjust its forecast and explain the change to the public.

V. The Feasibility of Setting Targets for the Monetary Base and Inflation
I would next like to explain my proposal to set targets for the monetary base and inflation. My proposal has already been outlined in the minutes of the Monetary Policy Meeting. It aims for an annual increase of 0.5 to 2.0 percent in the consumer price index (CPI) excluding perishables in two years' time, while increasing excess reserves by about 500 billion yen over one reserve maintenance period, and continuing to increase the amount thereafter to produce annual growth of about 10 percent in the monetary base. Inflation targeting would be employed as a framework to achieve the objectives of monetary policy, with a certain growth rate of the monetary base as the intermediate target. In the minutes, I have added a note explaining the need for the Bank to increase outstanding reserves from present levels, assuming a certain amount of growth in banknotes, by about three trillion yen by the end of March 2000 so that markets can get an idea of the volume of funds the Bank provides.

In case the adoption of targets for the monetary base and inflation is insufficient, I suggest the Bank take measures, such as directly buying assets that cannot be substituted with base money, in order to expand the money supply. The Bank could, for example, buy long-term government bonds with remaining maturities of over one year from the market.

A. The Framework of Monetary Base Targeting
Allow me now to explain the details of the framework of monetary base targeting. To practice monetary base targeting as a policy, the degree of growth in the monetary base and the instruments used to measure growth should be decided by methods that are objective not discretionary. The outline of the quantitative easing I have proposed is based on the McCallum Rule devised by U.S. Professor Bennett McCallum. This rule is used to calculate the growth rate of the monetary base needed to achieve the potential rate of GDP growth using such economic information as the rate of change in the velocity of money and the differential between the potential and actual rates of nominal GDP growth. According to this rule, when the growth rate of nominal GDP is below potential GDP growth, the growth rate of the monetary base should be increased to make the differential smaller. Let us assume that the potential growth rate of Japan in real terms is two percent and that the targeted inflation rate is one percent. To achieve GDP growth of about three percent, calculations using recent GDP data and the rate of change in the velocity of money show that the necessary growth rate in the monetary base is about 11 percent. I would say that around ten percent growth in the monetary base would be adequate.

B. The Transmission Mechanism of Quantitative Easing
I will next give my personal opinion on how positive effects from quantitative easing are transmitted to the economy. I would like to add that the transmission mechanism of the zero interest rate policy is not entirely clear.

The first kind of effect is transmitted through a decline in interest rates on term instruments with relatively long maturities. Japan is now in a situation where the overnight call rate has fallen as low as possible, and it can no longer be said that interest rates and the amount of liquidity are ""two sides of the same coin."" However, there is still some room for the rates of longer-term instruments to fall. It is my opinion that a further easing of monetary policy through quantitative measures would, therefore, trigger a fall in the interest rates of term instruments and stimulate the real economy. I would like to add that, if the economy were to improve as a result, the expected rate of inflation would rise in the medium to long term, and nominal interest rates would also rise. In the short term, however, real interest rates would ease, and a favorable impact would be likely.

The second effect stems from financial institutions changing their portfolios. When quantitative easing is adopted, funds become abundant in the short-term money market. There is a limit to the amount of funds that tanshi companies can accumulate in their accounts at the Bank. Therefore if the Bank's supply of funds were increased further from current levels, the excess reserves of financial institutions would be likely to eventually grow larger. I will explain this point later. Financial institutions might then choose to shift their funds away from reserves to the bond and stock markets or increase their extension of loans. To facilitate this flow of funds, it is necessary to combine quantitative easing with inflation targeting and change the expectations of economic entities.

The third is the effect from a rise in the expected inflation rate lowering real interest rates. A fall in real interest rates below the expected rate of return will stimulate business fixed investment.

In addition to these direct effects on the real economy from the monetary side--transmission down the main stream--there are two more transmission mechanisms. These two mechanisms were at work when the zero interest rate policy was temporarily exerting the same effects as a quantitative easing.

One is the effect from a weaker tendency in the value of the yen. For example, it is widely known that institutional investors such as life insurers and hedge funds watch the ratio of base money between Japan and the United States as a major factor determining their foreign exchange trade.

The other is the effect from a rise in stock prices. As of the end of September, the aggregate value of shares listed on the first section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange amounted to 400 trillion yen, up more than 100 trillion yen compared to 288 trillion yen as of February 25. It is hoped that firms will use their increased unrealized gains on stocks to further restructure business.

C. The Feasibility of Quantitative Easing
I will now move on to explain the feasibility of quantitative easing. Opponents of monetary base targeting have criticized my proposal on the following grounds: first, that it is not clear whether annual growth of 10 percent in the monetary base and an increase of 500 billion yen in excess reserves are consistent; second, that a further increase in the supply of funds would only accelerate the flow of funds to institutions that are not required to hold reserves at the Bank, and will not lead to an increase in reserves; third, that the Bank does not have extra capacity to expand its money market operations; fourth, that with interest rates at almost zero, bids received in the Bank's money market operations have sometimes fallen short of the offered amount, and this shows it would be difficult to increase the provision of funds; and fifth, that the monetary base is unsuitable as a target for monetary policy because methods to deal with wide fluctuations in the monetary base, caused by exogenous factors such as uncertainty over the financial system, have not been spelt out.

I would like to present my arguments in response to these criticisms. First, I will explain why growth in the monetary base of 10 percent and an increase in excess reserves of 500 billion yen are consistent. The logic used to come up with the figures I proposed at the September 21 Monetary Policy Meeting is as follows. To achieve year-on-year growth of 10 percent in the monetary base in the January-March quarter of 2000, the outstanding average monetary base of January-March 2000 should be 63.8 trillion yen. This means the monetary base, using data from August 1999, needs to be increased by more than 860 billion yen each reserve maintenance period starting from that beginning in mid-September. Banknotes in circulation, which account for more than 80 percent of the monetary base, have grown by about six percent year on year in recent months, and based on this, banknotes in circulation will continue to grow by about 390 billion yen per month. The difference between 860 billion yen and 390 billion yen is 470 billion yen, which is close to the 500 billion yen I have proposed. By filling this gap with an increase in reserves, annual growth of 10 percent in the monetary base would be achieved. I have ignored seasonal factors for the purpose of simplicity. I believe the size of the increase in reserves can be determined at Monetary Policy Meetings based on the thinking I have just explained, and by using data on the growth rate of banknotes in circulation and the monetary base.

The second criticism is that an increased provision of liquidity would only lead to an increase in the accounts at the Bank of institutions that are not required to hold reserves, such as tanshi companies, and would therefore not boost the level of excess reserves. I do not agree with this view. Tanshi companies act only as brokers for uncollateralized call transactions between financial institutions, that is, a borrower financial institution--which is subject to reserve requirements--always exists for each transaction. Considering this, it must be through collateralized call transactions that tanshi companies, as dealers, borrow funds from financial institutions and then accumulate the funds in their accounts at the Bank. As the amount of collateral tanshi firms have is limited to about 1.5 trillion yen, if the Bank were to raise its injection of funds to aim for excess reserves of three to four trillion yen instead of the current one trillion, I believe the bulk of the increase would end up in the reserves of financial institutions, which create money. In this context, one solution would be to encourage tanshi companies to act as brokers in the collateralized call market instead of dealing on their own account.

On the third point, the new market operation decided at the October 27 Monetary Policy Meeting--outright purchases of short-term government bonds--together with traditional operations such as repo operations, purchases/sales of TBs and FBs under repurchase agreements, and CP and bill operations should suffice. At present, the overall amount of funds the Bank can provide with these operations and other measures is said to total more than 30 trillion yen. These operations should make it possible to supply the amount of funds needed to realize my proposal, even if the need arose to boost supply to meet strong fund demand, e.g., that at the end of the year. If these operations are inadequate, one option for the Bank would be to buy instruments with longer maturities such as government bonds. Another possibility would be to follow the example of countries such as Switzerland and Australia and supply funds through foreign exchange swaps as a supplementary measure. I am sure the Bank could draw on its wealth of wisdom and produce many other viable measures.

On the fourth point, the shortage of bids in money market operations, my proposal would solve this problem because inflation targeting would somewhat raise the expected rate of inflation in the medium to long term. Theoretically, there are two measures that could be taken in the meantime. One would be to push interest rates below zero and the other would be for the Bank to buy long-term instruments. I personally think the adoption of negative interest rates would give rise to various problems and that the Bank, if necessary, should buy long-term instruments. For the time being, I plan to watch and assess the efficacy of the new money market operation--outright purchases of TBs and FBs--decided by the Policy Board on October 27. The TB and FB market has developed and its outstanding value is forecast to grow to 63 trillion yen by the end of this fiscal year. There are certain issues, such as the 26th, 27th, and 28th, that market participants strongly want the Bank to buy outright. By responding to the market's needs and actively using market operations such as TB and FB operations, the problem would be likely to be more or less solved, even though bids might still occasionally fall short of the offered amount.

The fifth criticism is that monetary base targeting is not a realistic practice because it is difficult to control the amount of banknotes in circulation, which account for the bulk of the monetary base, as demand for banknotes tends to show large fluctuations due to factors such as uncertainty over the financial system. I am fully aware of this risk and that is why I added the following in my proposed directive, which you can read in the minutes of the Monetary Policy Meeting on September 21: ""Regardless of the above target for the monetary base, the Bank will expand money further should the financial markets destabilize, for example, should the uncollateralized overnight call rate rise substantially."" Monetary Policy Meetings take place at a relatively frequent rate of twice a month. The Policy Board can assess the state of the economy at each meeting, and change the directive in line with the economic conditions. If necessary, extraordinary meetings can be convened. What is important is to clearly explain the changes in the directive to the public. I also think it is worth considering the idea of instituting a lending facility similar to that of the ECB that allows financial institutions to borrow funds when they want to.

Other than the criticisms I have just mentioned, I often hear the argument that the Bank's balance sheet would be impaired if it were to buy a large amount of long-term government bonds as part of a quantitative easing. I have discussed this topic with prominent U.S. and European economists, and most of them have said they cannot fathom why a central bank, which has its seigniorage enshrined in law, is so worried about damaging its balance sheet. Even if one viewed the Bank of Japan as a private enterprise, the probability of the Bank collapsing is extremely low, according to an ALM model, as Mr. Hideya Kubo at NLI Research Institute has previously said. The view that the Bank's balance sheet is very sound and that the Bank has the capacity to acquire a sizable amount of assets is shared widely. Ultimately, the Bank exists to facilitate the sound development of the economy. Considering this, what is the point of keeping the balance sheet of the Bank healthy when the economy is suffering? It would be problematic of course if the Bank were to underwrite a massive amount of government bonds and as a result its holdings of long-term government bonds ballooned. Such a scenario, however, can be avoided by the restrictions provided by setting targets for the monetary base and inflation.

D. Inflation targeting
I would next like to explain the framework of inflation targeting, which I believe should be used as a tool to achieve the objectives of monetary policy. The combination of inflation targeting and monetary base targeting forms the core of my proposal. First, I would like to make clear that my proposal differs from the inflationary policy advocated by Professor Paul Krugman, which aims for a relatively high rate of inflation, but is similar to the framework adopted by a number of countries that aims for price stability. At present, a number of countries including the United Kingdom, New Zealand, Canada, and Sweden practice inflation targeting. It is difficult to evaluate the performance of inflation targeting as it has not been practiced over a long period of time, but I believe it has yielded satisfactory results so far. Academic research on this topic has developed quite rapidly around the world. I have been told that at the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City conference in Jackson Hole in August, Professor Ben Bernanke of Princeton University and Professor Mark Gertler of New York University presented a paper on the effectiveness of inflation targeting in achieving macroeconomic and financial stability even in an environment of volatile asset prices. I have also been told that discussion on inflation targeting at that conference was profound and enlightening. It is my understanding that the majority has a positive view towards inflation targeting, and its opponents are limited to several central banks. The inflation targeting I have proposed would be an embodiment of the Bank's philosophy stipulated in Article 2 of the Bank of Japan Law--""Currency and monetary control shall be aimed at, through the pursuit of price stability, contributing to the sound development of the national economy.""--by providing a concrete number. Among the many price indicators, I have chosen the CPI because it is closely connected with the daily lives of the public. Perishables have been excluded as their prices tend to be volatile due to factors such as the weather, and thus their inclusion makes it difficult to judge trends. Some of you may be wondering why I have proposed setting an inflation rate of 0.5-2.0 percent while at the same time I have talked about aiming for zero inflation. The reason for this is that Japan's CPI is said to overstate inflation by around 1 percentage point, and I have factored this into my calculations. The upward bias in the CPI in the United States was verified in 1996 by the Boskin Commission appointed by the U.S. Senate Finance Committee. The Boskin Commission's report proved the CPI in the United States did not fully reflect the improvement in the quality of goods, such as personal computers, or bargain sales by discount stores, and thus, CPI data give a higher level of prices than prevails in reality. In a rare study on Japan's CPI, Mr. Shigenori Shiratsuka of the Bank of Japan estimates an upward bias of 0.9 percentage point. My estimate is an upward bias of about one percentage point, which includes an allowance for accidental errors. Then, allowing 0.5 percentage point room for maneuver below and 1.0 percentage point above, my target for the CPI (excluding perishables) becomes a rise of 0.5 to 2.0 percent.

I did not equally balance the range above and below an increase of 1.0 percent in the CPI because I concluded that a smaller range downward would strengthen the probability of a recovery in the dismal economy. I think it is possible for Japan to achieve the target in about two years' time--the same timeframe as the United Kingdom's target--which would be around October-December 2001. If I am able to study the matter further, I may be able to suggest inflation targets for Japan, of say, one to three percent, or 2.5 percent as is the case for the United Kingdom, that are consistent with the potential rate of economic growth.

I will next talk about the advantages of inflation targeting.

The first is that it gives monetary policy discipline. Many people claim that excessive quantitative easing leads to a high rate of inflation, but my proposal avoids such a situation by calculating the level of the monetary base that would be adequate before deciding a monetary policy objective that aims for 0.5 to 2.0 percent inflation.

The second is that it uses concrete figures, not ambiguous phrases such as ""a situation that is neither inflationary nor deflationary."" This would test the true accountability of the Bank. The Bank would need to explain its actions and also take responsibility for the results.

The third is that, as a result of adopting inflation targeting, the monetary authorities would need to be more conscious of the course of the economy. This would oblige the Bank to apply preemptive and truly forward-looking policies, instead of reacting to developments after they occur. The Bank of England (BOE) raised interest rates by 25 basis points on September 8 even though the inflation rate was below the targeted 2.5 percent. This was because BOE Monetary Policy Committee members recognized the need to take action to keep prospective inflation in line with the target as inflation could accelerate in the second half of the year against the background of strength in the housing market, a tightening of the labor market, and a sharp increase in consumption. As this example shows, central banks that practice inflation targeting need to analyze and forecast the course of the economy and this enables them to take preemptive action.

The fourth is that inflation targeting would facilitate dialogue between the central bank and the financial markets. Some market participants appear unable to foresee how long the zero interest rate policy will continue, or unable to find clues to make a forecast. If a concrete inflation target and target date are set, market participants can analyze the path that the economy will take and this is likely to improve communication between the Bank and the market. Numerical targets may also have a direct impact on market expectations, and this may prompt active dialogue.

The fifth is that it would shield the Bank from political pressure. The Bank of Japan Law stipulates price stability as one of the objectives of the Bank, but there is no clear definition of what level of inflation is accepted as stable and thus there is room for discretion on the interpretation. Furthermore, the Bank is truly independent in its policy making. I believe the Bank should adopt inflation targeting to achieve its objective of price stability, and take the initiative to announce a targeted inflation rate. The Bank's independence would be fortified by making all efforts to achieve the target. Where the target cannot be achieved, the Bank should explain the reasons and, if necessary, reprimand those responsible.

The adoption of inflation targeting is of vital importance for the Japanese economy and for the implementation of monetary policy. I am confident it will be adopted in the not so distant future.

VI. Concluding Remarks
The next few years will be critical for the Japanese economy. If Japanese industry comes successfully through this harsh era and improves capital efficiency through restructuring, the Japanese economy will revive, and from the perspective of long-term economic cycles, I believe the economy has the potential to reach a new peak around 2010. To this end, it is crucial that the Bank demonstrates its strong resolve to contribute to the economy by adopting targets for increases in the monetary base and inflation. I am sure such steps would free Japan from deflation and pave the way for a sound development of the economy. Courage and action--to adopt new monetary policy and pull the Japanese economy out of this extremely difficult phase--are what are required of the Bank.

I hope to continue to contribute to monetary policy to ensure the prosperity of Japan in the 21st century.

"Nov. 29, 1999","Remarks by Sakuya Fujiwara, Deputy Governor of the Bank of Japan, at the Third Financial Forum of Europlace on November 29, 1999","Introduction
Ladies and Gentlemen,

It is my great pleasure today to be a part of this important Financial Forum of Europlace. Listening to the lively comments of the distinguished guests regarding industrial reorganization in the area was indeed stimulating and thought provoking.

In the limited time I have, I would like to talk about three issues: recent developments and tasks facing Japan's economy, the internationalization of the yen, and the relationship between the EU and Japan.

1. Recent Developments and Tasks Facing Japan's Economy
During the eight years since the bursting of the bubble, Japan's economy has experienced mounting deflationary pressures and the need to effect radical structural reform. While Japan's economy has stopped deteriorating and is currently beginning to improve with exports and production increasing, clear signs of a self-sustained recovery in private demand have not yet been observed. Based on such a judgment, the Bank of Japan has been pursuing its zero interest rate policy, which will be maintained ""until deflationary concerns subside."" While keeping such a policy in place, we have taken a flexible stance in monetary operations, for example by providing ample funds over the year-end in view of the possible increase in fund demand related to Year 2000 problems.

For monetary easing to have an effect on the real economy and for private demand to recover in a self-sustained manner, the intermediation function of financial institutions needs to be restored and the demand for funds in the corporate sector strengthened. With regard to financial intermediation, it might be safe to say that the extremely cautious lending stance of financial institutions once observed has largely retreated due to steady progress in the disposal of non-performing assets and the injection of public funds to recapitalize major banks at the end of March. In addition, financial consolidation has advanced faster than expected, as witnessed by the recent announcements of a big merger and alliance among financial institutions. At present, however, the non-performing asset problem has yet to be totally resolved, and it may well take some time before we see a marked improvement in the financial intermediation function.

Regarding the demand for funds, the bursting of the bubble had a deep impact on the corporate sector. With lingering excess capacity and excess debt, many firms have tended to repay debt rather than engage in forward-looking activities as cash flows have improved.

This line of thinking highlights the importance of structural adjustment for bringing the Japanese economy back to a sustainable growth path. As you know, the United States has enjoyed an upbeat economy since March 1991, and the Schumpeterian process of ""constructive destruction"" has often been cited to have played an important role in its success to date. And, as I learned today, industrial reorganization across countries in the EU area is gaining momentum triggered by monetary unification. Unfortunately, in Japan, we have not seen the birth of many new firms which are likely to lead the economy, and we have yet to see the visible progress of structural changes. It will be an urgent task for industries to revitalize themselves by promoting structural changes in a competitive framework which is conducive to increasing risk-taking activity. I hope that the ""Comprehensive Economic Policy Package"" which was recently announced by the government will encourage such changes. Though it may take a little more time, I am convinced that the Japanese economy will exhibit the potential to transform itself once again into an economy with vitality and high productivity.

2. Internationalization of the Yen
Let me now turn to the second issue, the internationalization of the yen. This issue has been discussed since July last year by the Council on Foreign Exchange and Other Transactions, an advisory group to the Minister of Finance and of which I was a member. In April this year, the Council published a report called ""Internationalization of the Yen for the 21st Century."" The Council not only studied the significance of the yen's internationalization, but also discussed specific measures to promote and implement internationalization, taking into account such dramatic changes as the Asian currency crises, the introduction of the euro, and the progress of Japan's Big Bang.

According to the Council's report, one of the main reasons for the recent crises was that Asian countries had linked their currencies to the dollar without paying due attention to trade and investment ties with other countries. Now, having been forced to de-couple their currencies from the dollar and adopt a floating exchange rate regime, some Asian countries may consider it desirable to link their currency to a currency basket. The basket is composed of multiple currencies, which, given the close trade and investment relationships between the Asian region and Japan, naturally includes the yen. To support such a development, it is necessary for Japan to prepare an environment in which the yen can be more easily used as an international currency.

In addition, a single key currency system based on the dollar runs the risk of developments in the US economy triggering significant adverse effects on the world economy. In this regard, I hope that the euro and the yen will complement the dollar to contribute to the stability of the international monetary system.

Bearing this in mind, to promote Japan's Big Bang and enable the Tokyo market to be on a par with other major international financial markets such as London and New York, we need to improve the attractiveness of the yen and create an environment conducive to investment from overseas.

Based on such thinking, the Council's report pointed out that, as a prerequisite for assuring the broad acceptance of the yen as an international currency, it is necessary to effect measures to make the yen more convenient to use. To these ends, the report called for measures to improve financial and capital markets as well as settlement systems, and to review practices related to both trading and capital transactions.

That was a brief outline of the Council's report. Now, I would like to tell you how the Bank of Japan views the internationalization of the yen. The Bank of Japan has repeatedly stated the importance of improving financial market infrastructure to make it more conducive to the internationalization of the yen. Greater usability of the yen both domestically and abroad would enhance its international credibility, thereby promoting internationalization. In this context, it is important to ensure that Japan's economy is on a sustainable recovery path as well as to make its financial and capital markets more efficient and stable.

Related to enhanced efficiency and stability, one of the important issues we have focused on recently is the liquidity of Japanese government bond markets. When one wants to hold yen assets, government bonds with negligible credit risks are likely to be selected for investment. If a large volume of transactions can be executed quickly with a minimum impact on prices in government bond markets, in other words if the markets are highly liquid, government bonds will become more attractive as an investment instrument. To have highly liquid government bond markets is also desirable for a central bank as they are important markets for its daily monetary operations.

Current Japanese government bond markets are not necessarily very liquid, and it is essential to increase their liquidity. In this regard, various reforms had been made from April through September. For example, financing bills have been issued through auction. Withholding taxes on the redemption of treasury bills and financing bills have been exempted. Withholding taxes on non-residents' interest income from government bonds have also been exempted under certain conditions. And, the securities transaction tax has been abolished.

In addition, since the Bank of Japan handles actual operations from issuance to the redemption of government bonds as well as their settlement, it is of crucial importance that we properly respond, both in terms of operations and computer systems, to the diversification of government bonds and changes in the tax system. And I can assure you that we have been putting highest priority on dealing with these issues. Furthermore, we have been cooperating with market participants in expanding and improving both market functions and the infrastructure through such efforts as realizing delivery versus payment, which links funds settlement with securities settlement, and shortening settlement periods.

As regards the future, 5-year government bonds will be introduced in February next year aiming at establishing a benchmark bond in the market, and discussions are underway on such issues as bringing repurchase transactions in line with global practice by shifting from the current bond lending and borrowing with cash collateral to the Western style of bond trading, introducing a special government bond program, which is called STRIPS, and the further shortening of bond settlement periods.

We have been making utmost efforts both operationally and systemically aiming at making the Bank of Japan Financial Network System a real time gross settlement system by the end of next year. We are also committed to making further efforts to establish more user-friendly financial markets by improving market infrastructure. At the same time, we would like to continue exploring, in cooperation with central banks abroad, the research and analysis of such issues as market transaction methods, the price discovery mechanism, and behavior of market participants so as to enhance our understanding of market forces which is necessary for formulating various policy prescriptions.

3. Relations between Europe and Japan
The EU area has tackled the unprecedented task of monetary unification and cleared the hurdles through determined efforts. Triggered by monetary unification, the economy of the area seems to have been vitalized as witnessed by intensified competition among firms and progress made in the privatization of public enterprises.

Such moves in the EU area have been reflected in the balance of payment relationship with Japan. In fiscal 1998, Japanese investment in foreign securities shifted from the US to the EU area. Looking at the total of four EU countries - France, Germany, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg - whose individual figures are available, there was a net investment of 7 trillion yen in the four countries and 3 trillion yen in the US. Such a trend has been continuing in fiscal 1999, and the investment in the four countries had already reached more than 5 trillion yen in the April to September period compared with 3 trillion yen in the US. Such a shift may have been induced by the enhanced attractiveness of euro-denominated assets stemming from monetary unification and the increased issuance of corporate bonds backed by active M&A in the EU area. Direct investment into Japan also reached a record high, a little over 1 trillion yen in the first half of 1999, exceeding by far the past record of 0.4 trillion yen for full 1998. The major factor behind the surge is industrial reorganization on a global scale as evidenced by Renault's capital participation in Nissan.

These developments illustrate that economic dynamism in the EU area since around the time of monetary unification has had a significant impact on Japan's economy and finance. I believe that both Japanese policymakers and firms can learn quite a lot from such dynamism in the EU area. The Bank of Japan sincerely hopes that dynamism will soon be restored to the Japanese economy through structural changes. And, the Bank of Japan would like to actively contribute to the discussion and analysis of such changes and necessary supporting measures.

Thank you for your attention.",,Negative,0.7699505091,,
"Dec. 7, 1999","Remarks by Sakuya Fujiwara, Deputy Governor of the Bank of Japan, to the Yomiuri International Economic Society in Tokyo on December 7, 1999 (On Recent Economic and Financial Developments and Monetary Policy)","Introduction
I am very honored to be invited today and given an opportunity to speak before such distinguished guests.

Since the bursting of the bubble, the Japanese economy has faced a host of structural problems and traveled a tough road toward economic recovery and financial system stability. Moreover, against the background of instability in international financial markets and domestic financial systems from 1997, the economy experienced further deflationary pressure in the course of last year. However, since spring this year, Japan's economy has gradually overcome such a critical situation and has recently shown some signs of recovery.

Let me first give an overview of the changes over the past year and discuss the challenges that lie ahead. Then, I would like to explain our thinking behind the current zero interest rate policy and the tasks we face.

1. Current Economic Situation and Economic Outlook
During the past year, views on the Japanese economy have changed significantly both in and outside of Japan. For example, the OECD's economic outlook in spring this year forecast minus 0.9 percent GDP growth for Japan in 1999 which was revised upwards to 1.4 percent last month. This increase was the largest among developed countries and the 1.4 percent figure is higher than those for Germany and Italy. Moreover, the projection for next year has also been revised upwards, from 0 percent to 1.4 percent. Such a projection may seem somewhat too optimistic in the eyes of corporate managers who are facing tough business conditions as well as households which are facing severe employment and income conditions. In fact, improvement in the economy so far owes considerably to public works and increased exports, and a self-sustained recovery led by private demand has yet to be observed. And, this is the very reason why the Bank of Japan continues to pursue its unprecedented accommodative monetary policy, namely the zero interest rate policy. Nevertheless, it should also be noted that signs of recovery are gradually being seen in the Japanese economy which at one time was on the verge of falling into a deflationary spiral.

Public investment and housing investment supported aggregate demand in the first half of this year. Also, despite the unfavorable income situation personal consumption performed relatively well which was largely due to the rise in stock prices and diminishing concern over financial system instability, leading consumers to harbor less anxiety with respect to the future. Moreover, in summer, overseas economies, especially Asian economies, picked up and exports began to increase conspicuously which led to an upturn in production. This increase in production has not only contributed to higher corporate profits but has also begun to increase household income through a rise in overtime pay. Taken all in all, Japan's economy has stopped deteriorating and is currently turning to improve.

That was a summary of Japan's economic performance from the viewpoint of demand and production, behind which there seem to exist three major underlying developments. First is the recovery of the financial intermediation function, second changes in the industrial structure, and third the interaction of economic recovery in Asia.

Recovery of the financial intermediation function
First, improvements in the intermediation function of financial institutions have begun to be observed. From 1997 through 1998 the financial intermediation function was greatly impaired because of the failure of some Japanese banks and the turmoil in international financial markets. For example, even blue-chip companies found it difficult to issue commercial paper and corporate bonds. Also, the lending stance of financial institutions became even more restrained. This not only restricted corporate activities but also made corporations and households very self-protective, all of which further accelerated the economic downturn.

However, the situation has gradually improved since spring. With the injection of public funds into financial institutions, their capital base has been strengthened. And, against the background of the ample supply of liquidity by the Bank of Japan under the zero interest rate policy, the liquidity concerns of financial institutions and corporations have largely dissipated. The enhanced credit guarantee system has also had a positive impact. As a matter of fact, various surveys show that corporate liquidity is steadily improving and the lending stance of financial institutions is beginning to be less strict compared to last year.

What I would like to especially emphasize here is that a steady improvement has been witnessed in the area of direct finance. During the 12 months up to October, the lending of financial institutions decreased by 8 trillion yen, whereas fund raising in the corporate bond market and CP market increased by 5 trillion yen. This suggests that more than half of what could have been raised by borrowing from financial institutions was obtained through direct financing. Various reforms by market participants such as the abolition of bond eligibility standards, enhanced disclosure, and the streamlining of the corporate bond settlement system are now beginning to bear fruit. The zero interest rate policy has revived risk-taking activities on the part of investors, which resulted in significantly improved environment for corporate bond issuance. For example, the share of bonds with a triple 'B' rating, which was virtually zero last year, increased to 10 percent recently.

Although the financial intermediation function in Japan has recently improved, it is still far from sufficient. We have learned from our experience of the severity of the economic downturn after the bursting of the bubble and also from recent developments that the financial sector has a profound impact on the real economy. Sustained economic growth is difficult to achieve without an efficient financial system and reasonable risk-taking activities.

Industrial reorganization
Second, we are seeing the beginning of changes in industrial structure. For the past several years, Japan's industries have been looking for potential areas to become the driving force of future growth. The difficulty in finding such areas has cast a shadow over corporate sentiment in the form of anxiety towards the future. Recently, however, some hopeful signs have begun to be seen.

One example is the stock market. During the past year, the Nikkei Stock Average has increased by about 50 percent, though performance differs greatly from sector to sector. While stock prices in such sectors as electronics and telecommunications have doubled, those in some sectors have not increased at all. Since summer, stock prices on the whole have been on a rising trend, but in terms of daily price movement, gainers have often been fewer than losers. Such a contrast is further widening and a small number of issues are increasingly responsible for pushing up the overall stock index. Market participants have focused more on promising small- and medium-sized firms. In fact, the stock index for the Second Section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange has increased 2.5 times and that for the OTC market 3.5 times while the Nikkei Stock Average has increased only 50 percent in the past year.

The information technology revolution is often cited as background to all these developments and I am encouraged to see the rise of new enterprises led by a spirit of entrepreneurship as represented by the so-called 'bit valley.' Since I am not an industrial analyst, I do not intend to predict which sector will be promising in the future. What I would like to emphasize is that a competitive framework in which promising sectors or firms can be created and nurtured is beginning to emerge in Japan.

Recovery of Asian economies
Third, we have begun to see a mutually beneficial relationship between the recovery in Japan and recovery in other Asian countries. As mentioned before, the increase in exports from Japan owes much to the recovery of Asian economies. At the same time, imports to Japan from Asia are also increasing at a considerable pace. For example, among the exports of NIEs to various countries, those to Japan have increased the most. This is due to such factors as the recovery of Japan's economy and further progress in the horizontal division of labor within the region. As such, overall intra-regional trade is also expanding. Of course, economic recovery in Japan and other Asian countries is still fragile since much of the recent recovery has been supported by the effect of macroeconomic policy and an increase in exports. And, it may take some time before financial systems are restructured and domestic demand fully recovers. Nevertheless, I believe that within the framework of the interdependent division of labor, a mechanism has been set in motion whereby recovery in one country is fed by recovery in others, thus enabling the economic expansion of the whole region.

Prospects for the recovery of domestic demand
So far I have summarized the background to the improvement in Japan's economy, but I must admit that we are not fully confident whether such an improvement will lead to sustained economic growth. This is because there are no clear signs of a self-sustained recovery in personal consumption and business investment, which are the main pillars of domestic demand.

With excess capacity and excess debt, many firms are still in the process of restructuring and cannot easily loosen the reins on their efforts to achieve efficient management and repay debt. The same applies for employment. Under such a situation, even if corporate profits increase and liquidity conditions ease, it will be difficult for firms to make additional fixed investments.

Given the pressure of restructuring put on firms, it is not easy to expect any clear improvement in either employment or the income environment for the household sector. I mentioned that recently personal consumption had performed relatively well considering the severe employment and income conditions. This is because of the rise in the propensity to consume. However, for a full-fledged recovery of personal consumption, employment and income conditions must stop deteriorating and the household sector believe that such conditions will improve.

Also, we need to carefully monitor developments in the foreign exchange market and the influence on the economy. From summer through fall, the yen appreciated rapidly and its recent movement remains somewhat unstable. So far the negative impact of the yen's appreciation on exports has been mitigated by the recovery of overseas economies and, on balance, does not seem to have had any major adverse effects on the economic outlook and business sentiment. Also, the resilience of Japanese exporting firms to fluctuations in the foreign exchange rate has been strengthened as they have made efforts to establish global production lines and make high value-added products since the 80s. Having said all this, the fluctuations since summer have been large and rapid and we will continue to carefully monitor their impact.

Challenges facing structural reform
Looking at next year, what can be done to strengthen the recovery of private demand? I believe the answer lies in this year's positive developments which I have just touched upon. To repeat, they are a recovery of the financial intermediation function and an improved competitive environment for industry. For example, although the financial intermediation function is improving, it is not yet sufficient. Let me amplify on this as an illustration.

When new firms are created, how they obtain funds differs significantly between the US and Japan. In the US, 70 percent of the funds come from own capital and most of the remaining 30 percent from venture capital and individual investors known as 'angels.' On the other hand, in Japan, own capital only amounts to less than 30 percent, and 70 percent of external funds are borrowings from financial institutions. According to a survey conducted by the Small and Medium-Sized Enterprise Agency, newly established firms find fund raising a major obstacle in starting business rather than human resource management and technological development.

Indirect financing still plays a large role in nurturing new industries and firms in Japan. Thus, it is most important that financial institutions quickly regain their strength to support such activities through the disposal of non-performing loans and the pursuit of efficient management. In this respect, we need to continue improving the financial infrastructure in such areas as asset liquidation.

At the same time, direct financing should be strengthened. In relation to the example of nurturing new firms that I just mentioned, the MOTHERS project of the Tokyo Stock Exchange, reform of the OTC market by Japan Securities Dealers Association, and a movement to establish NASDAQ Japan are part of new developments to facilitate their fund raising. There are high expectations that these developments will contribute to strengthening direct financing. As for industrial reorganization, the Comprehensive Economic Policy Package recently drawn up by the government included many measures to support the reform efforts of small and medium-sized enterprises and to promote deregulation in growth industries.

Finally, I would like to emphasize that macroeconomic policy such as monetary and fiscal policy cannot replace structural policy. Macroeconomic policy, in the present structural context, is only a measure to buy time. In addition, we should remember that the fiscal deficit has expanded to a considerable extent and that monetary policy is being conducted when the short-term interest rate is virtually zero. Of course, the Bank of Japan will strongly support economic recovery by continuing the zero interest rate policy. However, while such macroeconomic policy measures have a supportive effect, it is necessary that various structural policy measures be implemented expeditiously to encourage forward-looking activities on the part of the private sector.

2. On Current Monetary Policy
Features of the zero interest rate policy
Now let me turn to the conduct of monetary policy.

Since February, the Bank of Japan has been pursuing extraordinary monetary easing through its zero interest rate policy. But because we have elaborated on the content and basic thinking behind this policy on various occasions, here I will only mention three features that have relevance to today's discussion.

The first is that the zero interest rate policy is a powerful monetary easing tool even when viewed from a quantitative aspect. In order to encourage the uncollateralized overnight call rate to move down to zero percent and maintain it at that level, ample funds need to be supplied. However, the provision of these funds by the Bank of Japan to the interbank market does not automatically lead to an expansion in bank lending and money supply. For such a process to work, financial institutions and the securities market must effectively discharge the function of financial intermediation and firms need to actively seek funds. While current financial markets can adequately respond to any positive developments in the real economy, it is important to strengthen the financial system and revitalize corporate activity through the structural measures I mentioned earlier.

The second feature is that the Bank has made a commitment to continue the zero interest rate policy ""until deflationary concerns subside."" As a result of this commitment, the effects of the zero interest rate policy have smoothly permeated to longer term interest rates. Except for the rise in over the year-end interest rates due to Year 2000 problems, interest rates with a maturity of up to one year have declined to the zero percent range.

In addition, such commitment has also given some flexibility to the zero interest rate policy. For example, let us assume that the economy receives an adverse shock. The market would naturally anticipate that lifting of the zero interest rate policy would be postponed. This would result in a swift decline in longer term interest rates with the overnight rate remaining at zero, thereby reinforcing the effects of monetary easing. We may call this ""the time framework effect"" of our zero interest rate policy.

The third feature is that the Bank has been strengthening its money market operations so as to assure permeation of the effects of monetary easing. For example, the Bank is prepared to continue the provision of ample funds and maintain the zero interest rate policy in the event of increased fund demand in the short-term money market due to the year-end factor or Year 2000 problems.

Since the zero interest rate policy is unprecedented both historically and worldwide, there have been a variety of suggestions and criticisms. For example, there are views which emphasize the negative side effects of the policy such that it distorts the income distribution of the household sector or delays structural reform. Such side effects certainly cannot be ignored. We recognize that the zero interest rate policy is an option that could, with these negative side effects in mind, barely be justified under the current situation. What is most important at this juncture is to support the economic recovery through extraordinary monetary easing, and, if successful, the favorable effects will surely spread to the household sector as well.

In contrast, there have been criticisms that the degree of monetary easing has been insufficient despite the zero interest rate policy. For example, the call for further quantitative easing is one such criticism. In this regard, as I stated earlier, the zero interest rate policy is in itself a powerful monetary easing measure from the quantitative aspect.

Some have suggested further monetary easing through unsterilized yen-selling foreign exchange intervention. If 'sterilized intervention' means 'the Bank absorbing all yen funds provided by individual yen-selling intervention through daily money market operations,' then the Bank is not implementing such operations. Under the zero interest rate policy, the Bank has been flexibly providing ample funds to the short-term money market in an amount more than necessary for financial institutions, taking account of factors including yen liquidity arising from foreign exchange intervention. On December 1, Governor Hayami issued a statement referring to this point and clarified once again the relationship between the Bank's money market operations and foreign exchange intervention.

In addition to these arguments, discussions on inflation targeting have recently gained momentum, and I would next like to give my views on that subject.

Two views of inflation targeting
Put simply, inflation targeting means setting a specific target inflation rate and conducting monetary policy aimed at achieving that target. This policy was adopted by countries such as New Zealand, the United Kingdom, and Canada in the early 90s. These countries had been suffering high inflation and through each respective central bank exhibiting strong commitment to containing inflation by adopting inflation targeting, they were successful in reducing inflation to some degree.

However, in recent discussions in Japan, there seem to be two different views on inflation targeting. One holds that inflation targeting is a measure for further monetary easing under the zero interest rate policy whereas the other regards it is a medium- to long-term framework for the conduct of monetary policy.

As a measure for further monetary easing, inflation targeting is utilized to escape from a deflationary situation. A somewhat high target inflation rate is set and all possible measures are mobilized until it is achieved. This line of thinking tends to suggest, in its extreme form, that a central bank should purchase all kinds of assets including long-term government bonds, stocks, and even real estate until it achieves the set target. This is a kind of 'reflation theory' disguised under the name of inflation targeting. On the other hand, inflation targeting can be regarded as a longer term policy framework that can be utilized to effect both monetary easing and tightening by putting emphasis on the long-term stability of market expectations and enhanced accountability of the central bank.

Problems with ""reflation theory""
In the past, there were occasions when reflation theory was put forward as a way out of a stagnant economy. It is argued that the revitalization of economic activity through moderate inflation would be good for the nation as a whole. In Japan, there are views that focus on the cost reduction effects of inflation since firms are suffering excess debt and the fiscal deficit has become quite large. However, to resolve economic problems by inflation is an extremely dangerous option and an unacceptable method for a central bank.

First of all, is it possible to realize ""moderate inflation""? Once inflationary expectations arise, more often than not they multiply themselves. And, once inflation emerges, we need to rapidly put the brake on the economy to combat inflation. Such a response runs the risk of a large swing in economic conditions. When people become uncertain about future prospects due to large swings in the economy and prices, their economic activities become defensive. Firms will suppress business investment and there is a high risk of economic dynamism being lost.

Second, we cannot neglect the negative impact of inflation on financial assets. The value of household financial assets, currently amounting to some 1,300 trillion yen, would be eroded in real terms by inflation. The depreciation of financial assets due to inflation would only aggravate the distribution problem, which is pointed out as a negative side effect of the low interest rate policy.

Third, is it possible to alleviate the debt burden by inflation? This question should be examined by taking account of the development of financial and capital markets as well as the trend toward globalization. For example, if people start worrying about future inflation, in an efficient financial market, such concern would be immediately translated into an increase in interest rates. In this case, while inflation might lessen the burden of past debt it would increase the burden of new debt. There is no guarantee that we could complete the clean-up of the aftermath of the bubble and achieve fiscal consolidation.

Therefore, to resolve problems by way of inflation is not only accompanied by extremely large side effects but also entails a high degree of uncertainty as to whether the desired effects can be achieved.

Inflation targeting and accountability
Inflation targeting, in its original concept, is a measure that emphasizes a central bank's strong commitment to its policy objective, price stability, thereby enhancing the transparency of monetary policy management. Since we have been making efforts to enhance accountability under the new Bank of Japan Law, we can thoroughly understand this concept. However, it is true that there are many issues that need to be addressed.

First of all, there are a host of problems in defining ""price stability"" by using a specific price indicator and setting a target. For example, which price indicator is desirable? How should we take account of external shocks? Is it possible to set a meaningful target rate when the quality of such products as personal computers and cellular phones improves or prices decline as a result of the rapid pace of technological innovation? One might say these problems are a matter of judgment, and there are indeed some such aspects involved. However, it seems to me that the problems pose a serious challenge involving a fundamental question like ""what is price stability?""

In addition, the relationship between inflation targeting and the transparency of monetary policy management is, in fact, not that simple. While it is true that monetary policy management would become easier to understand if numerical targets were introduced, since a relatively long time is needed before the effects of monetary policy permeate the economy, it is almost impossible to set a current rate of inflation as a target. It thus becomes necessary to conduct monetary policy by assessing the target rate with a forecast of the future inflation rate. For example, in the United Kingdom, the target inflation rate for two years ahead is set at 2.5 percent. The Bank of England recently tightened its monetary policy despite the recent inflation rate being only 2.1 percent. This episode typically illustrates that, in order to assure medium- to long-term price stability, policy judgment should be made taking account of various factors including potential inflationary pressures.

What we have discussed so far tells us that an overall judgment taking account of the future state of the economy and price developments is essential for the conduct of monetary policy, regardless of whether inflation targeting is adopted or not. If so, it is equally important to clearly explain policy decisions and the thinking behind them.

At present, the Bank of Japan is explicitly stating its stance to ""continue the zero interest rate policy until deflationary concerns subside."" This can be regarded as having the same effect as inflation targeting while avoiding difficulties in setting a numerical target. Having said this, we will continue to study methods and frameworks regarding the conduct of monetary policy paying due attention to various opinions both at home and abroad.

Thinking behind ""deflationary concerns subside""
Finally, let me explain what we mean by ""we will maintain the current zero interest rate policy until deflationary concerns subside."" The following questions are often put to us: Haven't deflationary concerns yet dissipated since the economy has begun to recover? Aren't the criteria rather unclear as to when such concerns are expected to subside?

Regarding current price developments, CPI and WPI are almost level. For example, CPI declined as much as minus 0.5 percent on a-year-on-year basis in September 1998, but is now around zero percent. According to this movement, we are not in a deflationary situation. However, in the framework of inflation targeting, what monetary policy should focus on is whether such price stability is sustainable for the future. Hence, what matters is not the current movement of price indices but the judgment regarding various risks concerning future price developments.

From such a viewpoint, in the situation where the sustainable recovery of private demand has yet to be seen and the risk of recession lingers, we cannot conclude that potential deflationary pressures have been sufficiently contained. Thus, it is too early to say that we have reached the stage where deflationary concerns have subsided. This is the majority view in our Monetary Policy Meetings up until now.

At Monetary Policy Meetings, policy board members will continue to carefully examine price developments taking account of such factors as whether the risk of the output gap further widening is judged to have become sufficiently small, and whether the probability of recovery exceeds that of recession. I would add that we will thoroughly explain our decisions and the thinking behind them to the market as well as to the public through our monthly economic reports and minutes of Meetings.

Concluding Remarks
Today, I firstly summarized the development of Japan's economy and the conduct of monetary policy during the course of this year. Then, I explained the challenges that lie ahead and our thinking behind the current conduct of monetary policy.

I hope that the positive developments outlined today will lead to a sustainable recovery of the economy and that the new millennium will usher in a truly new beginning for Japan's economy. In this regard, it is vitally necessary to revive the dynamism of the Japanese economy through not only macroeconomic policy such as monetary and fiscal policy but also structural policy and the innovative power of the corporate sector. To this end, the Bank of Japan will continue to make the utmost efforts.

Thank you for your attention.",,Negative,0.7652969956,,
"Dec. 24, 1999","Speech by Masaru Hayami, Governor of the Bank of Japan, at the Federation of Economic Organizations on December 24, 1999 (Toward a New Millennium)","1. Introduction
I am honored to have an opportunity today to address such distinguished guests. Now that there is only a week remaining in the 1990s, it is perhaps appropriate that I say a few words about the last ten years which have sometimes been referred to as 'the lost decade.' Japan's economy has indeed trodden a very difficult path since the bursting of the bubble. But, in walking this very difficult path, it is also true that we have slowly but steadily nurtured the forces to prepare for a new age, as suggested by the term 'creative destruction.' Moreover, we have recently witnessed various developments that bring hope of a future. Today, by looking back at Japan's economy in the 1990s, I would like to discuss some of the issues which will be carried over to the forthcoming millennium from the perspective of the central bank.

2. The Japanese Economy in the 1990s
Under a prosperous world economy
Average annual growth of the Japanese economy was as high as 10.5 percent in the 1960s, started to slow down to 5.2 percent in the 1970s, and declined to 3.8 percent in the 1980s, tracing a gradual shift from high growth to stable growth. Then, growth further dropped to 1.7 percent in the 1990s. And, especially during the eight years from 1992, growth was only 1.0 percent, a figure we could have never anticipated in the 1980s when everybody was talking about the possibility of Japan trading places with the US and euphoric phrases such as 'Japan as Number One' were heard.

As a matter of fact, the 1990s has been a decade blessed with two new growth opportunities, namely the progress of information technology and the globalization of market economies. The US economy, though experiencing moderate growth in the early 1990s due to lingering effects of the credit crunch, has since been expanding steadily accompanied by the unprecedented combination of low unemployment and low inflation. In addition, the once seemingly withered European economies suffering from fiscal deficits and high unemployment have regained their vitality through efforts related to currency unification, a symbolic event for the beginning of a new era, and are now eagerly looking forward to the new millennium. And, turning to Asian economies, in the early 1990s they realized amazingly high growth often praised as 'a miracle.' Unfortunately, due to various distortions brought about by too rapid growth, they subsequently experienced difficult times triggered by the currency crises in 1997. But since the beginning of this year many Asian economies have been exhibiting a rather solid rebound. One general and significant feature of the 1990s is that, against the background of the increase in supply capacity due to the expansion in emerging economies as well as the appropriate management of macroeconomic policy in industrial countries, the foundation for price stability has become firmly embedded in economic structures worldwide.

Background to the stagnant 1990s in Japan
The question is why couldn't the Japanese economy take full advantage of such favorable global economic environment. Various factors can be cited, but today I would like to point out three: the mounting pressure of the non-performing asset problem, uncertainty about future prospects stemming from changes in demographic composition, and an inflexible economic structure.

The first and foremost factor behind low growth in the 1990s is presumably a decline in risk-taking ability due to the non-performing asset problem. A mutually reinforcing decline in both stock and land prices considerably eroded the capital position of firms and financial institutions. With impaired balance sheets firms naturally became cautious in taking on new risks in terms of business fixed investments, and with the looming non-performing asset problem in the background, the financial intermediation function of financial institutions was substantially weakened. In particular, the fact that indirect financing was central to corporate finance caused balance sheet problems at financial institutions to have a greater and more persisting impact on the real economy.

Potential growth opportunities found in the progress of information technology and globalization can only be seized when firms actively take risks and financial markets sufficiently support their fund-raising activities. Unfortunately, such risk-taking activities in Japan have been considerably weakened in the 1990s. In fact, a modest recovery of Japan's economy from 1994 through 1996 was vulnerable because the problem remained unsolved. Accordingly, when major financial institutions collapsed and the financial system was shaken in autumn 1997, Japan's economy again faced strong deflationary pressures. This only reaffirmed that the economy would never exhibit a solid recovery unless financial system stability was restored.

The second factor which occasioned low growth in the 1990s was the change in demographic composition, typically a problem of fewer children and an aging society. Although the future demographic composition had been somewhat accurately predicted in the 1980s, the illusion that 'the economy would always be on a rising trend,' in other words, overly optimistic presumptions about such factors as economic growth and return on assets, disguised the real problem. Hence, when the bubble burst, it became rapidly apparent that firms, households, and the public sector were not fully prepared for the emergence of an aging society. Many sensational headlines such as ""Are your pension funds safe?"" started to appear in the media, and uncertainty about the future has been casting a shadow over the consumption behavior of households. Suppressed private consumption, which comprises 60 percent of total demand, seems to have deprived firms of a bright future.

The third factor is that Japan's economic structure lacked flexibility to promptly adapt to big changes in the environment. Innovation in the area of information technology and globalization has completely altered the pricing system and necessitated considerable changes in the allocation and utilization of capital and labor. In other words, information technology and globalization provided opportunities for growth that could only be realized when accompanied by corresponding changes in industrial structure. But, for an economy that is not flexible, such changes in the environment do not always have positive effects in providing growth opportunities. Rather, they could burden the economy by lowering competitiveness and placing downward pressure on corporate profits.

The economic system and practices such as life-time employment, the crossholding of shares, various regulations that shielded industries from competition, and financing through main banks, had positive effects during the high economic growth period. But with the environment undergoing drastic changes, they have now become more of a constraint. The information revolution has had a substantial effect in expanding economies, especially in the US, and oft-cited reasons with respect to the US include a flexible labor market, prompt 'top-down' decision-making, and the effective use of risk capital. In Japan, a corporate culture that puts emphasis on stable employment and income as well as decision-making based on consensus has long prevailed. It has had some rationale and benefited Japanese firms under a certain pattern of economic growth. However, when an economy is faced with fundamental changes, such a corporate culture has tended to prevent firms from closing down non-profitable sections and reorganizing staff and management systems so as to seize new growth opportunities. Though small and medium-sized firms are inherently in a position to flexibly adapt to drastic changes, there were rather strict constraints with respect to funding. In the 1990s, financial system instability prevented both the expansion of small and medium-sized firms into new areas and also the emergence of innovative firms since they were unable to easily raise risk capital.

Current state of the economy
Now let me turn to recent economic developments.

With the improvement in corporate profits due to the increase in exports and production, the Japanese economy as a whole has recently started to improve. However, business fixed investments have not yet been activated by the improvement in profitability, and private consumption has not necessarily been on the rise reflecting the severe employment and income environment. Hence, clear signs of a self-sustainable recovery of private demand are yet to be seen. Bearing such a situation in mind, the Bank of Japan is maintaining its extraordinarily accommodative zero interest rate policy.

Nevertheless, the economic environment surrounding private demand is gradually improving. While such improvement has so far relied heavily on monetary and fiscal policy as well as the favorable situation with respect to overseas economies, we have begun to observe some positive changes in the factors behind the stagnant 1990s.

If such changes are real, the Japanese economy will be able to regain vitality over the medium to long term. There might be some justification for being optimistic because the yen's appreciation against the US dollar and the euro in the latter half of this year seems to be largely attributable to an increase in overseas investors betting on the resurgence of the Japanese economy, resulting in the increased inflow of capital into Japan. Of course, we need to be vigilant about the development of the yen rate since an excessive appreciation might nip the economic recovery in the bud. Having said this, it is an encouraging sign to see a movement to 'buy Japan' in markets both at home and abroad. A 40 to 50 percent increase in stock prices during the past year and the disappearance of the so-called Japan premium can also be interpreted in this context.

Then, what are the recent positive changes in the Japanese economy? Let me elaborate on them by referring to the aforementioned three factors which caused stagnation in the 1990s. With respect to the non-performing asset problem, since this spring financial system stability has been restored to a large extent against the background of the injection of public funds into major financial institutions. Various surveys indicate that the lending stance of banks is less strict compared with last year. And, while debt overhang still hampers the risk-taking activities of firms and the financial intermediation function of banks is still weak, we can say that the risk of the non-performing asset problem paralyzing the entire financial system and thereby aggravating anxiety on the part of firms and households has become quite small.

With respect to the second factor, demographic composition, firms have begun to look into new business opportunities regarding services for the elderly such as health and nursing. It is true that, with the birth rate declining, we cannot solve the pension problem without pain. This is a fact of life that we have to face. But we can equally say that the problem can be solved if each generation would agree to share such pain. Recent discussions on this issue seem to incorporate such a pragmatic viewpoint. Indeed, fewer people are obsessed with anxiety regarding the future of the pension system, and many are looking at diversified pension schemes such as defined contribution plans and asset formation as Japan's Big Bang advances, which can be regarded as a positive development.

And, with respect to the third factor, that is, adaptability of Japanese firms to changes in the environment, I strongly feel that there have recently been important changes which are worth noting. One such change is full-fledged restructuring among major firms which has been gaining momentum since early spring this year. Moves for full-scale alliances among major banks, something which could never have been imagined in the past, have been emerging. Some more time will be needed to see whether such moves end up as just restructuring, meaning withdrawal from non-profitable areas and the reduction of workers, or actually bear fruit as re-engineering which goes beyond the existing organization and business practices and aims at raising profitability through the concentrated allocation of resources to strategic areas. In this regard, developments such as the rise in stock prices since spring can be interpreted that investors both at home and overseas are expecting such changes to materialize.

In parallel with developments at large firms and financial institutions, one of the changes that I am encouraged to see is the rise of new enterprises as represented by the so-called 'bit valley' centering on the telecommunications sector. In the capital market, promising small and medium-sized firms are increasingly attracting attention. The Nikkei Stock Average has increased about 40 to 50 percent, the Second Section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange 2.5 times, and the OTC market 3.5 times. Also, new developments to facilitate fund raising by newly established firms are being seen, such as the MOTHERS project of the Tokyo Stock Exchange, reform of the OTC market by the Japan Securities Dealers Association, and a movement to establish NASDAQ Japan. There are high expectations that these developments will contribute to strengthening direct financing. It is true that the situation in Japan is still behind the US where new firms raise 70 percent of their funds from own capital and the remaining from venture capital and individual investors known as 'angels.' Nevertheless, it is a welcoming sign that a competitive framework in which promising and risk-taking firms are created and nurtured is beginning to emerge in Japan.

3. Toward a New Millennium
A flexible economic structure that accommodates changes
In the new millennium, there is little doubt that the two conspicuous changes seen in the 1990s, namely the information revolution and globalization, will progress even more. Though no one can predict precisely how fast these two megatrends will advance or what business opportunities they will offer, it is certain that the speed with which new technologies and ideas are transferred across borders will accelerate, wherever they are created. Whatever we do will entail considerable uncertainty and the environment in which corporate managers make decisions will likely change constantly.

Therefore, it will become all the more necessary for corporate management to be flexible enough to accommodate such changes and uncertainty. To support corporate activities, infrastructure related to accounting, tax, and legal systems as well as a deep and liquid capital market will hold greater importance. It will continue to be an important challenge for us to establish a flexible economic structure that can promptly adapt to unpredictable changes, which can be achieved through developing a highly transparent system and improving a framework that can efficiently manage various risks. In short, it is important to build an economy where the market mechanism functions effectively. In the 1990s, we were busy dealing with the aftermath of the bubble, and all we could do was support the economy through monetary and fiscal policy. In the coming millennium, with the progress of structural reform and enhanced awareness of the need to change on the part of both individuals and firms, I strongly hope that Japan's economy will take advantage of the progress of information technology and globalization, and that growth will be led by private demand.

Two hopes as a central banker
I would like to mention two hopes that I have in mind on entering the new millennium, both of which relate to the Japanese economy regaining dynamism.

One of the hopes is that we quickly overcome ""deflationary concerns,"" to secure price stability, and build a dynamic economy propelled by innovation. Specifically, price stability is extremely important for economic expansion that accompanies a change in industrial structure. In an economy where people are confident of the maintenance of price stability over the medium to long term, they will not be excessively worried about changes in the macroeconomic environment and will be able to devote their efforts to appropriately assessing the risk of individual projects. This will intensify private sector energy in expanding economic frontiers. Hence, when price stability is clearly maintained, the change in relative prices of individual goods and services will be correctly recognized. In this way, the market mechanism, taking cognizance of price signals, will be fully functioning, thereby promoting the appropriate redistribution of labor and capital.

As such, it is recognized that price stability is indispensable for economic prosperity over the medium to long term. Such a recognition has been shared worldwide as the environment has changed during the 1990s. Despite this, there still exists in Japan the view that monetary policy should accommodate some inflation, which strongly suggests to me that Japan's economy is currently not in a normal situation. It is my sincere hope that Japan's economy will regain its inherent strength and promptly return to a normal economic situation where people can feel secure about the future, confident that the central bank is containing inflation.

The other hope is that the status of the yen as an international currency will rise as confidence in Japan's economy is restored. At present, the 15 EU countries account for a little less than 30 percent of world GDP, and European currencies are used for 20 to 30 percent of world trade and foreign exchange reserves. Their share of GDP almost corresponds to that of the use of their currencies. In the case of the US, its share of global GDP is almost the same as that of the EU, but the US dollar is used dominantly for 50 to 60 percent of world trade and foreign exchange reserves. In contrast, Japan has an approximate 15 percent share of GDP, but the use of the yen for trade and reserves is only 5 percent. Currently, yen-denominated exports are only 36 percent of total exports and the figure for yen-denominated imports is 22 percent of the total.

It is expected that, as globalization progresses, international capital flows through trade, direct investment, and securities investment will likely become more active. Thus, strengthening the infrastructure for international fund settlements and ensuring the stability of the international financial system is an important agenda throughout the world. The role of Asian economies will become increasingly significant in the development of global finance and the world economy. Bearing such a perspective in mind, it appears natural to think that the importance of the yen as an international currency is potentially quite large.

For the yen to be used internationally, it is necessary, first, for Japan to garner greater credibility including its economic policy, and, second, to make the yen more convenient to use. As for credibility regarding Japan's economy, we need to ensure non-inflationary sustainable growth. And, as for making the yen more convenient to use, we need to have efficient money and capital markets. In this regard, the issuance of financing bills through auction from this April and the subsequent substantial expansion of the financing and treasury bill markets was a welcome step. However, it is true that the reasons why the international use of the yen has not easily increased are rather complicated, involving some historical factors. It is my hope that a variety of suggestions and ideas will be put forward by business people leading to constructive discussions and whatever measures possible in this direction will be expeditiously implemented.

4. Concluding Remarks
To be Governor of the Bank of Japan when entering a new millennium is a stroke of fate. The Bank of Japan for its part will make the utmost efforts so that Japan's economy will successfully lay the foundation for a new era. I sincerely hope that those from the business world will move bravely forward so that various new innovative movements now being observed will lead to the full-fledged revitalization of Japan's economy.

In closing, may the 1990s be long remembered, not as 'the lost decade,' but as 'the decade that lay the foundation for the prosperity of coming generations.'

"Feb. 4, 2000","Speech given by Eiko Shinotsuka, Member of the Policy Board of the Bank of Japan, at the Meeting on Economic and Financial Matters in Nagano on February 4, 2000 (Monetary Policy and Structural Reform of the Japanese Economy)","I. Introduction1
It is a great honor to have been invited to speak at this meeting and exchange views with you, the leaders in various sectors in Nagano Prefecture. I would like to take this opportunity to express my gratitude for your kind consideration extended to our branch and office in this prefecture.

The Bank of Japan conducts monetary policy and its business operations under the new Bank of Japan Law, which has been established on the two principles of ""independence"" and ""transparency."" It is, therefore, a major responsibility of the Bank to give the general public an adequate explanation of the thinking behind its monetary policy and business operations. The Bank's executives and staff, including myself, must have a good understanding of the Bank's policy and business operations and actively exchange views with people in various fields, thereby deepening mutual understanding between the Bank and the public. I hope today's meeting will help enhance this mutual understanding.

Let me start by discussing the Bank's thinking and my personal view, which is somewhat different from that of the majority of the Board, on the Bank's implementation of monetary policy. Later, I will turn to issues I consider to be important for the structural reform of the Japanese economy.

This article is excerpted and translated from the speech given in Japanese.
II. The Zero Interest Rate Policy
A. What Is a Zero Interest Rate Policy?
The Bank implements monetary policy by adjusting the supply of funds in line with demand for them in the money market through market operations. Since February 1999, the Bank has kept the uncollateralized overnight call rate, the operating target, at virtually zero percent--this is the so-called zero interest rate policy. Viewed from another angle, this means that the Bank will inject funds into the money market without limit whenever necessary. In fact, the Bank is supplying funds in such large volume that excess funds continue to remain in the market.

The Bank, at its Monetary Policy Meetings (MPMs), decides the guideline for market operations that covers the intermeeting period of about half a month or a month ahead. Market participants, on the other hand, often engage in funds transactions that become due in three or six months. This requires them to forecast movements in the overnight call rate during the period between the next MPM and the maturity date of their transactions. Consequently, when the outlook for interest rates is uncertain, interest rates on term instruments, such as three- or six-month instruments, could become substantially higher than the prevailing overnight rate.

To avoid such an outcome, the Bank has announced its intention of maintaining the zero interest policy ""until deflationary concern has been dispelled,"" suggesting possible continuation of the policy beyond subsequent meetings. This announcement aims at ensuring that the effects of the zero interest rate policy permeate the economy. As a result, money market rates, including those on three- to six-month instruments, have stayed around zero percent.

When the Bank adopted the zero interest rate policy about a year ago in February 1999, there was an extremely strong unfavorable interaction between the economy and the financial markets. Sluggish economic activity had made market participants increasingly worried about the stability of the financial system. Had extreme pessimism spread in the financial markets, Japan's economy could have plunged into a crisis. This situation could have overly restrained economic activities, such as business fixed investment and household spending.

The zero interest rate policy effectively stopped the unfavorable interaction between economic activity and the financial markets by removing concerns among market participants that they might face difficulties in fund-raising due to a liquidity shortage in the market. In the meantime, the Financial Function Early Strengthening Law and other legislation enacted in the autumn of 1998 provided the framework for the stabilization of the financial system. In March 1999, approximately one month after the adoption of the zero interest rate policy, major banks were recapitalized by injection of public funds. Moreover, fiscal spending was increased significantly to support economic activity. Thanks to the synergy generated by these policy measures, a considerable degree of stability has been restored in the financial markets in the past year.

B. What Does the Phrase ""Until Deflationary Concern Has Been Dispelled"" Mean?
Japan's economy, which had stopped deteriorating, has recently started to improve, with exports and production increasing. The economic environment surrounding private demand is gradually improving as seen in the continuing increase in corporate profits. Despite these developments, the Bank judges that clear signs of a self-sustained recovery in private demand have not been observed yet, and therefore continues the zero interest rate policy.

Under these circumstances, the timing of a policy change and the meaning of ""until deflationary concern has been dispelled,"" which is generally regarded as the criterion for terminating the current policy, have again become the focus of attention.

What then does ""until deflationary concern has been dispelled"" mean? It may be understood as to mean ""until a self-sustained recovery of the economy driven by private demand could be forecasted with a certain degree of probability."" Generally, deflation is defined as a spiral of declining prices and contraction in economic activity: an overall decline in the level of prices brings about a fall in corporate profits and wages; and this fall leads in turn to a contraction in economic activity, resulting in another price decline. This indicates that the economic momentum behind price developments is an important criterion in identifying the risk of prices declining further.

Misinterpreting the phrase ""deflationary concern,"" some people seem to focus only on price indicators. However, factors affecting price declines include technological innovation and increased management efficiency. These factors would increase production and create a positive momentum in the economy. In such circumstances, a strong deflationary concern will not be confirmed despite the fall in prices.

C. Personal View on the Zero Interest Rate Policy
I hold an opinion different from the majority of the Policy Board. I believe that the Bank should terminate the zero interest rate policy and change the guideline for money market operations back to that employed before the adoption of the current policy on February 12, 1999. I believe this for two reasons.

First, I see that abatement of deflationary concern is already in prospect. I expect a self-sustained recovery in private demand, triggered by a recovery in business fixed investment. And although it is still difficult to forecast when business fixed investment will clearly turn upward, the environment has gradually become favorable since last autumn.

Corporate profits, which provide the wherewithal for business fixed investment, have become more likely to increase, reflecting reductions in personnel expenses and debts. Japan's labor market has been known to be less responsive to changes in the supply and demand balance of labor, i.e., there is relative inflexibility in both wages and the number of employees. In the 1990s, Japanese firms' return on capital deteriorated sharply due primarily to a considerable rise in labor's relative share. This rise was a result of a combination of the decline in the growth rate of the economy and a climb in hourly wages reflecting a reduction in working hours and a rise in the average age of employees paid under the seniority-based wage system. Recently, however, labor's relative share has been declining slowly as a result of a review of the seniority-based wage system and the increasing proportion of part-time workers.

Around last spring, many people were concerned that reduction of personnel and other expenses by firms would depress employees' income and hence private consumption, which, in turn, would prevent corporate profits from increasing as expected. However, while cost reductions have continued, private consumption has in fact remained virtually unchanged. This owes much to the improvement in consumer sentiment brought about by abatement of uncertainties over the stability of the financial system, and a recovery in stock prices.

Given this situation, it would be quite reasonable for firms to increase fixed investment if an increase in sales could be expected. Meanwhile, an improvement in business sentiment in general is reported in the Bank's Tankan--Short-Term Economic Survey of Enterprises in Japan--and other surveys.

A large number of firms are now in the process of business restructuring, aimed at creating a new business model to improve return on capital on a sustained basis. For this, a mere cost reduction is not sufficient. It is essential to establish a new core business and to strengthen it by concentrating management resources. Business fixed investment has been restrained to a certain degree, but this situation is not expected to last for long. Moreover, various stimuli to business investment are recently being observed, such as the dramatic technological innovations in new areas including information technology (IT), environmental technology, and biotechnology. I believe that a certain critical level at which business fixed investment turns upward is close.

There is an argument that, even if cash flow improved, the cash gained would not be directed to business fixed investment but instead to the repayment of debts. However, progress in reducing excess debts varies greatly from industry to industry, or even company to company. I therefore expect industries or firms whose debt burdens are relatively light and the sectors characterized by rapid technological innovation to lead a recovery in business fixed investment.

Firms are expected to continue to hold down wages. However, given the improvement in corporate income, the source of wages, I believe that there is now a smaller risk of a drop in private consumption caused by deterioration in income conditions and consumer sentiment.

The second reason for advocating a termination of the zero interest rate policy is the intensification of its adverse effects. There has been a distortion in income distribution; this has negatively affected especially the household sector, which is being denied interest income it would have otherwise earned. Structural reform is being delayed; too much easing of the pain of structural reform is producing unintended effects. Market participants' risk awareness is being diluted. And institutional investors, such as life insurance companies and pension funds, are facing difficulty in finding good investment opportunities.

Japan's ""bubble"" in the latter half of the 1980s left the country with a load of projects with low profitability and productivity. Undoubtedly, part of this phenomenon is due to monetary policy. However, an equally important cause was the lack of proper awareness of the cost of capital among firms and financial institutions. Reflecting on this bitter experience, I feel that it is essential to heighten the awareness of the cost of capital of economic entities to promote the kind of structural reform being called for. Undeniably, an emergency measure like the zero interest rate policy is necessary in ""abnormal circumstances"" to stem an extremely strong unfavorable interaction between economic activity and the financial markets combined with a deep pessimism over the future of Japan's economy. In a capitalistic economy, however, the incentive for promoting structural adjustment is unlikely to grow if such an emergency measure is continued.

Needless to say, it is not fair to evaluate the zero interest rate policy by focusing solely on its adverse effects. However, while the disadvantages manifest themselves as time rolls on, the risk has been diminishing of the economy being pushed back to the verge of a deflationary spiral. I believe the prospect of a self-sustained recovery in private demand is growing. On a comprehensive judgment of the changes in the situation, I believe that the time is right to terminate the zero interest rate policy--an extreme measure.

I would also like to mention two points I consider to be particularly important in connection with the termination of the current policy.

First, although I am in favor of terminating the zero interest rate policy, I do not believe that the Bank should shift its monetary policy stance toward tightening in one stroke. The overnight call rate of 0.25 percent, which prevailed before February of last year, is still very low. Therefore, guiding the rate back to this level would still be an easy monetary policy that would accommodate the current economic situation.

Second, the shock of terminating the zero interest policy on the financial and capital markets should be contained at the minimum. One reason for this is the fact that long-term interest rates reflect expectations for future short-term rate developments--that is, they reflect forecasts for economic activity and monetary policy implemented in response to the resulting economic situation. Therefore, heightened uncertainty regarding monetary policy could cause a surge in long-term interest rates. Stock prices and the yen could also shoot up. To avoid such developments, the Bank will have to explain to the market its thinking regarding monetary policy with the utmost clarity upon termination of the zero interest rate policy.

III. Structural Reform of the Japanese Economy
Unfortunately, the 1990s are known as the ""lost decade"" for the Japanese economy. The prolonged economic recession is attributed not only to the after-effects of the economic ""bubble"" but also to the failure of the Japanese economy to adapt to structural changes: advances in information technology; the proliferation of market economies, particularly in Asia; the low birth rate; and the aging of Japan's population.

This does not mean that the Japanese economy has no capacity for further growth but that it should seek new frontiers. What Japan needs to do is to reform various systems that affect the decision-making of economic entities. Today, I would like to take up two themes among the numerous issues relating to structural reform: the so-called IT revolution and employment system reform. A look at Nagano Prefecture from these two aspects reveals the following. A relatively high concentration of IT-related industries in Nagano Prefecture is realizing more rapid production growth than that in the rest of the nation. With respect to employment, this prefecture boasts one of the highest active opening ratio of job offers to job seekers in the nation. I hope to hear your comments on this situation later.

A. Information Technology Revolution
Advances in information technology would have various economic impacts including an increase in demand for related information services, as well as for hardware such as IT-related equipment and parts. Apart from these direct impacts, they are also expected to promote restructuring of various systems.

Generally speaking, an economic and social system cannot remain entirely organization-specific and completely isolated from the broader economic environment and technological foundation. In Japan for many years, business transactions within each corporate group have been a common practice. However, with advances in information technology, information networking--where the greater the number of participants, the more useful the service becomes--may promote a rapid expansion of transactions across the conventional framework, as seen in the United States over the past few years. For the Japanese economy to place itself on a new path of growth, the existing systems--i.e., the structure of the whole economy as well as of individual organizations including firms and the government--should be broken down and constructed anew to enhance the productivity of the nation's labor and capital.

A reform in the business model is expected to increase the productivity of industries where it is said to be below international standards. Japan's nonmanufacturing sector is well known for its low productivity and low efficiency--a by-product of heavy regulation and protection from price competition. This inefficient nonmanufacturing sector is threatening the international competitiveness of the manufacturing sector, in which intermediate input from service and other nonmanufacturing industries is growing in importance. However, the expected expansion of business-to-business or business-to-consumer e-commerce--in other words, direct transactions between the producer and the final user--may improve the efficiency of the economic system as a whole.

Nevertheless, advances in information technology are just a necessary condition for a further growth in Japan's economy. It is up to each one of us to take advantage of them. Innovations in information technology are sometimes referred to as ""the IT revolution."" In order for them to have economic effects comparable to those of the Industrial Revolution, we will certainly have to completely change our way of thinking, as well as to radically reform areas such as regulation, the tax system, and employment policy.

B. Employment Problems
Employment conditions remain very severe despite some indicators suggesting a halt in the deterioration of the situation. In addition to over-employment, a cyclical problem, Japan faces the structural problem of a low birth rate and aging of its population. My focus in what follows will be on these structural issues. Prior to my appointment as a member of the Policy Board of the Bank of Japan in April 1998, I was conducting research on the labor market at Ochanomizu University, Tokyo, and I am currently a member of the Ministry of Labor's Central Employment Security Council. I should emphasize, however, that the views I am about to express are my personal thoughts on this subject.

1. A long-term shortage of labor
There are two underlying causes of a shortage of labor. One is the impact of the low birth rate and the aging of the population. The National Institute of Population and Social Security Research has estimated Japan's population based on the rather bold assumption that the average birth rate of 1.43 recorded in 1996 and the present average life expectancy will hold true eternally. Just for your information, the rate dropped further to 1.39 in 1997. The Institute projects that Japan's population will decline from the present approximately 125 million to approximately 49 million by the year 2100, approximately 300,000 by 2500, and just to one person by 3500. At the same time, the proportion of elderly people will increase further. The Ministry of Labor forecasts that, of the total labor force, those aged 55 years or older will make up 29 percent in 2010 compared to 23.1 percent in 1998.

Another potential cause of a shortage of labor is a mismatch between skills wanted and those available in the labor market. For example, Europe is beset by a high unemployment rate in the national economy as a whole, while individual firms are reported to face shortages of labor, ranging from highly skilled workers in the field of information processing technology to relatively unskilled workers required by service industries. Japan too could find itself unable to fill job openings in such fields as information and telecommunications, nursing care for the elderly and healthcare, and other areas.

2. Diversification of working style
Given the projected decline in Japan's labor force and the current mismatch between the supply and demand of labor, I believe that a system should be created to encourage women and the elderly wishing to work to actively join the labor market, in other words, to raise the total labor force participation ratio.

Japan's employment system had been based on a stereotypical division of labor between men and women, such as ""man the breadwinner, woman the homemaker"" or ""men in core posts and women in supporting roles,"" but this should now change. The economy and the employment structure have changed, and people's sense of values is becoming more diversified. Workers, regardless of their gender or age, now wish to choose the working style that best suits their lifestyle from among many alternatives: part-time work, temporary work, and teleworking, besides conventional full-time employment.

For example, part-timers rose from 16.3 percent of those in employment in 1998 to 19.8 percent in the fourth quarter of 1999. Some people see this as a reflection of the harsh employment and income environment. They argue that some people are forced to take part-time jobs despite a desire to work full-time or that full-time homemakers are compelled to take a job to supplement the decreasing income of their husbands.

I do not mean to reject these arguments, but I see the diversification of working styles in a more positive light. The Netherlands is noteworthy in that it has successfully changed the structure of the labor market. For example, as a result of the promotion of part-time work, approximately 30 percent of workers are now part-timers. A typical household has two wage-earners: one full-time and the other part-time. This type of double-income family is said to have many advantages. It can withstand economic fluctuations better than a single-income family; its members can achieve a good balance between work and their family lives; and it allows a couple to take turns in receiving professional education to improve their productivity.

Those of the elderly wishing to work could also continue to participate in the labor market if they are given more choice of working styles, such as part-time or teleworking, rather than having to choose between full-time work and no job at all. I understand that Nagano Prefecture has the lowest per-capita medical expenditure for the elderly in the nation, while at the same time it is one of the prefectures with the longest average life expectancy. This, I attribute to the prefecture's high labor force participation ratio of the elderly--one of the highest in the nation. The favorable environment for the elderly is encouraging them to remain active members of society. I believe these proactive efforts on your part are significant, in that they provide a model of how to cope with the imminent aging of Japan's population.

The transformation of Japan into a society with various working styles to suit everyone will also benefit employers. They will be able to respond flexibly to the changing business environment as well as to hire competent employees with the knowledge, skills, and experience required.

3. Importance of human resources development
I believe that the diversification of working styles will gradually weaken the strong attachment to long-term employment both on the part of the employer and employees. Long-term employment is likely to be maintained in areas of core competence, where technology and know-how need to be accumulated and passed on to the next generation. Overall, however, labor mobility could well increase in the future.

A new employment environment should be created in the near future to allow both the employer and employees to act more freely on their own initiative. For example, it is essential to review various systems, including the tax and social security systems, to avoid putting those changing jobs at a disadvantage. At the same time, support should be extended to individuals to allow them to receive vocational training and other types of human resources development education to become more productive. As the structure of the Japanese economy changes dramatically, continuing education will become ever more important. For example, some middle-aged or older workers who have accumulated company-specific skills and know-how may wish to receive special education in computer and networking. To make it possible for these motivated people to realize their wishes, a system should be built in which individuals can develop their abilities on their own initiative according to their life plans.

In relation to this issue of human resources development, the government is currently reviewing the Employment Insurance Law. While unemployment benefits will continue to provide a social safety net, discussion is now underway to transform the employment insurance system into a more flexible one that encourages the acquisition or improvement of job skills to help workers find new employment. The primary function of the government's three types of employment insurance service, which is governed by the Employment Insurance Law, has been preventing unemployment. Under these insurance services, various subsidies to businesses were provided to prevent them from shedding workers. In the future, however, I believe that support should be extended to individual workers to help them develop their talents and skills on their own initiative throughout their working life, instead of providing employers with subsidies.

"Mar. 17, 2000","Speech given by Masaru Hayami, Governor of the Bank of Japan, at the Asian Pacific Bankers Club on March 17, 2000 (Globalization and Regional Cooperation in Asia)","It is a great honor to be invited today and given an opportunity to address distinguished members of the Asian Pacific Bankers Club. In particular, I would like to commend the Club for providing a valuable forum for fostering mutual understanding among representatives of major banks in East Asia and the Pacific region.

More than two years have passed since the outset of the currency crisis in Asia, and we can now say that we have clearly witnessed a recovery. Thus, at this juncture, I believe it useful to examine what kind of regional cooperation is desirable in Asia from a long-term perspective.

Positive and Negative Sides of Globalization
Let me first consider globalization. The essence of globalization is the integration of markets worldwide and the deepening of various interdependent relations. As we all know, the speed of globalization has been accelerating, especially in financial markets. This is clearly evidenced by the significant increase in foreign exchange transactions and international bond issues over the span of the past ten years.

You will all agree that the rapid progress of information and communication technology has played a decisive role as the driving force behind globalization. But, we should not forget the dynamic mechanism whereby globalization creates pressures for the harmonization of such systems as accounting, taxation and corporate governance across borders, which, in turn, leads to further globalization. As is commonly said, 'globalization begets globalization.'

Thus, the move toward globalization is an inevitable reality, and not likely to be reversed. Bearing in mind such a reality, we need to examine the problems related to globalization and how we should respond to them.

Globalization has brought about a variety of changes. One obvious benefit from a long-term viewpoint is that active cross-border capital flows will realize the efficient allocation of world resources. At the same time, precisely because of enhanced efficiency, there is a greater risk that the rapid increase in international capital flows will induce an unexpected adverse impact, as was the case when financial crisis contagion following the outbreak of the Asian financial crisis in 1997 spread to Russia and Latin America.

Given the fact of life that globalization is not reversible, what we need to do is to minimize the negative side of globalization. In fact, since the financial crisis in Asia, various measures have been effected to prevent international contagion stemming from financial crises and to improve the international financial system.

These measures include the improvement of disclosure to achieve enhanced market discipline, the establishment of a domestic financial system which is robust and resilient to external shocks, closer international cooperation in terms of financial supervision, and the review and strengthening of IMF functions.

Progress of Regional Cooperation
Amid globalization, it is worth noting that we have also witnessed a clear trend toward regionalism or regional cooperation in various parts of the world. These movements toward promoting regional cooperation have taken due account of trade and financial relations.

For example, in Europe, the introduction of the euro and the expansion of the EU. In the Americas, the expansion of NAFTA and dollarization which is being considered by some Latin American countries. In Asia, we have begun to observe some moves toward closer cooperation as I will describe later.

Can we reconcile these two contrasting trends, the progress of economic and financial globalization on the one hand, and the strengthening of regional cooperation on the other? One possible interpretation of this difficult question is that the driving force behind globalization has also made the interaction of economic and financial activities closer in regions which have a lot in common. For example, the rapid progress of information and communication technology can be regarded as one of the major factors supporting the integration of financial markets in the euro zone.

Therefore, globalization and regional cooperation can proceed simultaneously. Furthermore, regional cooperation, if managed properly, will promote globalization. For example, if there are problems for which it will take a long time to form a global consensus, it may be possible to reach a consensus relatively quickly among specific regions. This is a case where regional cooperation lowers barriers to globalization in countries within the regions concerned.

Furthermore, if there is a common platform for discussion or a framework for solving problems in a region which consists of countries with similar economic conditions and policy orientation, we may be able to reduce the cost of global negotiations in the event of international policy conflicts or shocks. In such a case, regional cooperation may supplement a global cooperative framework.

It may sound a little ironic, but regional cooperation has become all the more significant and important when globalization progresses rapidly. The global economy of the twenty first century will most likely be a multi-layered global network of various forms of regional cooperation.

Regional Cooperation in Asia
Now, I would turn to regional cooperation in Asia. Needless to say, Asia is extremely diverse in terms of culture, politics, and religion. Such diversity entails difficulties in promoting regional cooperation. In fact, the speed of regional cooperation in Asia has been slow compared to other regions.

However, it is also true that the extent of interdependence has become more widespread and deep as witnessed by the progress of the horizontal division of labor and increased capital flows in East Asia. In addition, since the bitter experience of the currency crisis in 1997 has made us recognize the risk of spillover and contagion, I believe that momentum for actively promoting regional cooperation as a device to support globalization has steadily increased.

In promoting regional cooperation, let me offer you three important points in the economic and financial area. First is the strengthening of mutual surveillance. It is a major premise for any regional cooperation that the countries concerned share a common recognition with respect to the economic and financial conditions of individual countries in the region, their interdependence, and the risks inherent in the regional economy.

Second, countries in the region should share a common view of the future direction of the regional economy and also concrete policy response based on such recognition. Bearing in mind the lessons we learned from the currency crises, we should improve the functioning of financial markets and foreign exchange regimes, and also strengthen domestic financial systems and financial supervisory frameworks. In order to make an appropriate policy response, not only coordination among countries in the region but also competition among them are very much needed.

Third is participation in global efforts toward the stability of the international financial system, which is often termed the 'New International Financial Architecture' problem. It seems to me increasingly important to send a coherent message from Asia to such international fora as the Financial Stability Forum, the Group of Twenty Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors, and the International Monetary and Financial Committee.

Having said all this, we should never forget the importance of maintaining the basic philosophy of 'open regionalism' as a major underlying premise to contribute to the stability and development of the world economy.

Central banks also play a very important role in promoting regional cooperation. As symbolized by the rapid expansion of derivative transactions, we now live in a world where international capital flows have become extremely complex and the speed at which a shock is transmitted across borders has accelerated. In such a world, it is not possible for the central bank of any one country to ensure integrity of the international financial system. This can be easily understood if we recall such problems as the liquidity risk involved in foreign exchange and the Herstatt risk in cross-border settlements.

To discharge the responsibility of conducting appropriate monetary policy and maintaining financial system stability as well as to prevent international systemic risk from emerging, mutual cooperation and coordination have become increasingly essential among central banks in the region.

In this context, a forum called EMEAP, composed of central banks in the East Asia and Pacific region, was established in 1991. In this forum, member central banks have been exchanging views and information regarding economic, financial market, and foreign exchange market developments. They have also been studying ways to make improvements in such areas as financial markets, settlement systems, and bank supervisory methods.

Conclusion
In closing, let me briefly touch upon Japan's role in Asia. Given the size of its economic presence and close relations with countries in the Asian region, Japan should make an appropriate contribution to regional development.

To this end, first of all, Japan itself must aggressively implement structural reform to realize robust economic fundamentals. At the same time, Japan should promote further opening and improvement of its domestic markets to contribute to the efficient and fair allocation of world resources.

Particularly in financial markets, various measures for improvement have been effected. For example, in the benchmark government bond market, the maturity of bonds has been diversified and the withholding tax on non-residents lifted. We should continue such efforts to make domestic markets more attractive for overseas investors.

Through such efforts, I believe and sincerely hope that countries both within and outside the Asian region will come to have greater confidence in Japan, which, in turn, will contribute to closer and stronger cooperation in Asia.

"Mar. 21, 2000","Speech given by Masaru Hayami, Governor of the Bank of Japan, to the Research Institute of Japan in Tokyo on March 21, 2000 (Price Stability and Monetary Policy)","I am honored to be invited to this meeting and given an opportunity to address such distinguished guests.

More than a year has passed since the Bank of Japan launched the zero interest rate policy in February 1999. During that time, Japan's economy has shown significant improvement thanks to aggressive monetary easing, fiscal stimulus measures, and the restoration of financial system stability. Underlying conditions for the recovery of private demand such as business fixed investment and household consumption have also continued to improve. Nevertheless, we still need to carefully monitor the effects of such improvement on the spending behavior of households and firms, particularly since the economy is faced with various structural problems. And, in view of the fact that Japan's budget deficit is the largest among major industrial countries, it should be noted that further stimulus from the fiscal policy side is not an easy option.

Under such circumstances, voices calling for additional measures on the monetary policy front have tended to become louder. And, some have begun to argue for tolerating a little bit of inflation. In fact, we have been receiving an increasing number of questions asking our views on ""inflation policy"" and inflation targeting. Though there is no single definition of inflation policy, it includes all policies which somehow artificially create inflation or inflationary expectations. Before responding to the questions, we first need to review the significance of price stability. In this regard, the Bank of Japan has recently announced that it will conduct a comprehensive study on price stability, and today's speech can be regarded as a prelude to such study.

1. Why Is Price Stability Important?
Significance of price stability
The new Bank of Japan Law which came into effect in April 1998 stipulates that the objective of monetary policy is to ""contribute to the sound development of the national economy through the pursuit of price stability."" When we emphasize the importance of price stability, we are sometimes criticized that the Bank of Japan is only concerned with inflation regardless of current economic conditions. Let me start by explaining that such criticism is not to the point.

Price stability is important because it provides the foundation for all kinds of economic activity and the people's livelihood.

The market economy is a structure within which firms and households make decisions regarding consumption and investment based on prices of individual goods and services. And, the general price level is a concept that consolidates individual prices of various goods and services traded in a country. In other words, the levels of individual prices can be evaluated against the general price level as a yardstick. In this framework, price stability means that this yardstick is reliable. If so, changes in consumer preferences and the progress of technological innovation will be efficiently translated into changes in individual prices. Thus, firms will be able to use changes in relative prices as a signal for their future business strategy. From a macroeconomic viewpoint, when the economic environment is continuously changing, stable prices facilitate the smooth reallocation of such resources as labor and capital and also technological innovation in response to, for example, consumer trends, thereby ensuring sound economic growth over the long run.

If prices fluctuate considerably and the yardstick becomes unreliable, then the signaling function of individual prices will be greatly weakened. In this case, labor and capital will not be easily transferred to growth industries, and the inefficient allocation of resources will ensue. In addition, an economy with unstable prices will likely experience unstable business cycles. This, in turn, will make it difficult for firms and households to formulate prospects regarding profits and income, which obstructs sound investment activity. Thus, if price stability is impaired, the long-term growth rate will decline.

Furthermore, price fluctuation distorts income distribution. For example, if inflation occurs, those with financial assets which are fixed in nominal terms, such as bank deposits, will see a fall in their real value. Conversely, those with financial liabilities will benefit from a reduction in their real value. As a result, inequality between those with assets and those with liabilities will arise. In contrast, if deflation occurs, the reverse inequality will follow.

Policy objective of the Bank of Japan
As such, price stability lays the foundation for sound economic development from the viewpoint of both efficiency and fairness.

The Bank of Japan has been aiming at price stability that is neither deflationary nor inflationary. It is a mistake to think that the Bank is concerned only with inflationary risks.

This can be understood from the conduct of monetary policy in the recent period. In February 1999, the Bank embarked on drastic monetary easing, namely the zero interest rate policy. And in April, it made clear its firm intent to maintain this policy until deflationary concerns are dispelled.

In view of current economic conditions and price developments, Japan's economy is judged not to be in the middle of deflation. What is frightening about deflation is that it induces a vicious circle called a deflationary spiral whereby price declines reduce corporate profits and wages which, in turn, leads to a slowdown in business activity and further price declines. These can be called ""pernicious price declines."" In fact, there was a very high risk of Japan's economy falling into a deflationary spiral up until around the spring of 1999, but concern over such risk materializing has greatly subsided in the past year. Both CPI and WPI have been almost level. Corporate profits have been increasing and economic activity gradually picking up. Though it is true that prices of a number of products have been declining, this is against the backdrop of various revolutionary changes including the so-called IT revolution, that is, the progress of technological innovation in information and telecommunications, as well as the revolution in distribution networks represented by the emergence of so-called ""category killers."" Such phenomena cannot necessarily be regarded as pernicious price declines.

Nevertheless, the Bank has been continuing its extremely accommodative policy symbolized by the zero interest rate policy. This is because, in our judgment, we might again face the risk of pernicious price declines until such time we can be confident that Japan's economy has achieved a recovery underpinned by private demand.

As such, the Bank of Japan has been conducting monetary policy by paying due consideration not only to inflation but also deflation.

2. Problems With Inflation Policy
Two views of inflation targeting
Recently there have been various discussions on setting a specific numerical target to the inflation rate in order to achieve price stability, namely inflation targeting.

At the outset, it should be noted that two different views have been discussed in Japan under the title of inflation targeting. Originally, inflation targeting is a policy framework to enhance the transparency regarding the conduct of monetary policy and to strengthen the credibility of the commitment to price stability. However, not a few advocate so-called inflation targeting in the same vein as inflation policy. Thus, before discussing inflation targeting in its original concept, let me say a few words about the problems involved with inflation policy.

Inflation policy is not a well-defined concept. Most typically, as Professor Krugman of MIT advocates, it is a policy which aims at a somewhat high inflation rate of 4 to 5 percent and mobilizes all possible measures to achieve this target. Professor Krugman appears to have asserted this rather extreme policy prescription based on a very pessimistic view of Japan's economy. As a matter of fact, however, Japan's economy has started to improve. And, it is our judgment that, under such economic conditions, we should never adopt a policy that is contrary to price stability.

There is a variation of inflation policy that says a moderate inflation rate of 2 to 3 percent is tolerable and it may vitalize economic activity. However, given the current situation in Japan where prices are almost level, such a proposal is tantamount to artificially creating inflation. Furthermore, to implement such a proposal, many have suggested that the Bank of Japan should increase its outright purchase of government bonds or underwrite them. Some even advocate that the Bank of Japan should purchase stocks or real estate. Thus, what started as a proposal aiming at a moderate inflation rate of 2 to 3 percent under the disguise of inflation targeting for price stability has ended up being the same as inflation policy in that inflation should be artificially created at any cost.

Inflation is no solution to economic problems
Regarding inflation policy, first and foremost, I would like to point out that inflation is no solution to economic problems. Inflation policy assumes that moderate inflation will revitalize economic activity, alleviate the debt burden of firms as well as financial institutions, and relieve the fiscal deficit problem. Apparently those who advocate inflation policy argue, while taking due account of its negative effects, that the intended positive effects would be greater than the negative effects under the current situation. But, if we look more closely, the intended positive effects themselves would not likely be achieved.

Needless to say, financial markets today are sufficiently developed in major industrial countries, including Japan, and integrated on a global scale. And thus prospects for the economy and prices in Japan are of considerable interest to investors worldwide. Here, let us assume that the Bank of Japan announces a target inflation rate and market participants both at home and abroad believe that the announced target will be achieved. A well-developed financial market would immediately discount this announcement and long-term interest rates such as the yield on government bonds would rise even before we actually observed inflation. In theory, the nominal interest rate is defined as the sum of the real interest rate and the expected rate of inflation. Therefore, with such an announcement, the nominal interest rate would be pushed up by the same degree as the rise in the expected rate of inflation, leaving the real interest rate, which influences economic activity, unchanged.

Furthermore, since uncertainty regarding the future normally increases as inflation rises, there would be a greater possibility that long-term interest rates might rise more than the amount corresponding to the increase in the expected rate of inflation because of risk premium accompanying higher uncertainty. If this happened, the debt burden of firms and the fiscal deficit would likely increase rather than decrease in real terms. The increase in long-term interest rates would also have an adverse impact on economic activity such as business fixed investment. Therefore, a policy to create inflation would most likely turn out to be counterproductive to the objective it was initially intended to achieve.

Those proposing the solving of economic problems by way of inflation often refer to the experiences of history or developing countries. But, compared to such experiences, Japan today is placed in a totally different situation in terms of the development of its financial markets and globalization. Indeed, we would face the problem I just mentioned whether the target inflation rate were 4 to 5 percent or 2 to 3 percent. In this regard, it should be emphasized that what Japan needs now is an increase in real economic growth, not a rise in inflation.

Difficulty of controlling inflation
The second point is that inflation is most likely uncontrollable once triggered. Once inflationary expectations take a firm hold on society, they tend to proliferate. Workers would demand higher wage increases than would otherwise be the case. If wage costs rise, firms would try to pass them on to product prices. Such an economy has a built-in risk of increasing inflationary pressure.

Some argue that since the Bank of Japan is an independent central bank, it can raise the inflation rate to 2 to 3 percent and then contain it around that level even if there exists further upward pressure. However, if we tried to contain inflation after it had gained momentum, we would need very strong monetary tightening, which might result in a substantial deterioration of economic activity and a steep climb in unemployment. While it is true that the Bank of Japan has the power to contain inflation, it is also true that enormous costs would be imposed on society to suppress inflation once triggered.

In fact, prevailing thought in major industrial countries until the 1970s held that economies would be better off if a little inflation were tolerated. Partly because of such lax monetary policy, the world economy experienced high inflation from the 1970s through the first half of the 1980s. And to contain such inflation, many countries had to experience such hardships as higher unemployment. Because of such bitter historical experience, major industrial countries have now discarded the idea that a little bit of inflation will improve economic activity. Mainstream thinking now says that price stability should be maintained by a policy which prevents inflation from arising in the first place.

Problems with further monetary easing
The third point concerns measures to create inflation. In Japan, we have already exhausted orthodox monetary easing measures. Even if we wanted to create very modest inflation, we would have to resort to such unorthodox measures as an increase in our purchase of government bonds or even underwriting them. But here it should be noted that there is a risk that the negative side effects might be quite large once the Bank implemented such unorthodox measures. The severity of Japan's fiscal situation has attracted attention from all over the world. Thus, if the Bank of Japan started purchasing government bonds in large quantities, credibility in them would most likely be impaired. Long-term interest rates would rise because of a higher risk premium occasioned by a deterioration in the creditworthiness of the Japanese government. Adoption of such a drastic policy would run the high risk of eroding not only fiscal discipline and the smooth functioning of financial markets but also the credibility of Japan itself.

Effects of the zero interest rate policy
Having said all this, we should ask ourselves whether there is anything more to do in terms of monetary policy. As a matter of fact, the zero interest rate policy is an extremely powerful policy tool for monetary easing. Under the framework that the zero interest rate policy will be maintained until deflationary concerns are dispelled, if uncertainty about the economic outlook increases, the timing of lifting the zero interest rate policy will be automatically delayed. By taking account of this automatic prolongation of current monetary policy, long-term interest rates will promptly decline. Thus, the zero interest rate policy is powerful in that it possesses flexibility of automatically absorbing, to a certain extent, the effects of any negative shock on the economy.

Currently, Japan's economy has started to improve. Industrial production continues to rise, and the increase in corporate profits is being confirmed. Though there remains uncertainty regarding the future, we have been observing quite a number of new developments in such areas as information and telecommunications. At this juncture, I believe it very important to promote structural reform and create an environment conducive to revitalizing the corporate sector while the economy is underpinned by fiscal and monetary policy.

3. Inflation Targeting
Original inflation targeting
Next, let me talk about the original concept of inflation targeting. Basically, it is a policy framework that emphasizes the strong commitment of the central bank to maintaining price stability and enhances the transparency regarding the conduct of monetary policy.

Inflation targeting has been adopted by such countries as the United Kingdom, New Zealand, and Sweden since around 1990. For example, in the United Kingdom, the target inflation rate is set at 2.5 percent for a price index roughly equivalent to CPI. At its monthly Monetary Policy Committee meetings, the Bank of England discusses the outlook for inflation and determines any necessary change in interest rates taking due account of the time lag for the effects of monetary policy to materialize so as to bring inflation to around 2.5 percent over the span of two years. Once every quarter the Bank of England releases an inflation report in which it explains the conduct of monetary policy and describes prospects for the economy and prices during the course of the following two years.

While implementation of inflation targeting differs from country to country, the fundamental common factors are (a) setting a target inflation rate, (b) conducting monetary policy with the aim of achieving the target over the medium term, and (c) making available a substantial amount of information including the economic outlook which is the basis for policy judgment. It should be noted that the central bank is not required to achieve the target inflation rate in the short run. The aim of inflation targeting is to contain inflationary expectations and enhance accountability regarding monetary policy by making a numerical target the medium-term objective.

This original concept of inflation targeting may have some merits. In fact, we have discussed the subject a number of times in our Monetary Policy Meetings. However, at the moment, I think adoption of such a framework in Japan presents many difficult problems.

Price developments in Japan
As far as prices are concerned, they have been very stable in Japan.

Inflation targeting was originally adopted as a policy framework geared toward price stability by those countries who were suffering from high inflation. For example, in the United Kingdom, the average rate of inflation was more than 5 percent during most of the 1980s, reaching 7 to 8 percent in 1990 and 1991. And, in 1992 inflation targeting was introduced. In the case of the United Kingdom, setting a target inflation rate at 2.5 percent is equivalent to announcing a strong commitment to containing inflation and maintaining price stability.

In contrast, since the early 1980s when the effects of the Second Oil Shock waned in Japan, the average rate of CPI increase has been very low at around 1 percent, and was only 3 percent at the peak of the bubble period when the economy was overheated. In the case of Japan, prices have been extremely stable for nearly twenty years. Thus, we have not been put in a situation where we have to set any inflation target to maintain price stability even if we have not solved such difficult problems as defining and measuring price stability.

New price revolution
The problem of defining and measuring price stability is whether we can set an appropriate numerical target for inflation based on a specific price index.

In addition to this rather difficult problem, we need to consider the possibility that major industrial countries, including Japan, are entering a ""new price revolution era."" Such development has been born of the rapid expansion of economic activity related to information and telecommunications, in other words the ""IT revolution."" This is characterized by extremely rapid technological innovation which induces price declines through the improvement in productivity and the development of new products. Since the mid-1990s the United States has witnessed stable and low inflation under extremely low unemployment, partly because economic expansion has been supported by the IT revolution. This phenomenon contradicts past experience.

In addition to this worldwide IT revolution, Japan has been experiencing dramatic changes in its distribution and service industries which can be seen as a revolution in distribution networks.

The progress of technological innovation and the revolution in distribution networks raise two big questions when analyzing prices. The first is whether prices of new products and price developments under the new distribution networks are appropriately reflected in price indexes. This is the oft-discussed issue of biases in price indexes. In view of the large number of new products and distribution networks available, this issue might have become more serious than previously envisaged. The second question is how to assess the price declines due to such revolutionary changes. If the IT and distribution network revolutions continue under the current situation of zero inflation, we cannot rule out the possibility that the economy could recover while the inflation rate is negative in terms of the existing price indexes, even though they may not sufficiently incorporate these revolutionary changes. And, in the case where cost reductions continue thanks to technological innovation, even if the inflation rate is statistically negative it would not be appropriate to judge the economy as being deflationary as long as it is recovering steadily.

When the environment surrounding prices is likely experiencing dramatic changes, we have to carefully examine whether it is possible to set an appropriate target for inflation based on existing price indexes.

Desirable rate of inflation
Whether an optimal inflation rate should be exactly zero percent or a small but positive number is another argument worth noting. Following are some of the reasons why the optimal inflation rate could be a small but positive number. First, as I mentioned, it appears not so easy for existing price statistics to fully incorporate actual price declines due to such factors as the revolution in distribution networks. This is the problem related to the upward bias of price indexes. Second, since nominal wages hardly ever decline, which is because of the so-called downward rigidity of nominal wages, economic adjustment would proceed more smoothly with a positive rate of inflation. Third is the zero boundary problem for interest rates. Since nominal interest rates, which can be controlled by the central bank, never fall below zero, room for further monetary easing would be limited if conditions worsened. In this regard, there is an argument that it is better to have a positive rate of inflation as a cushion so that the central bank can maintain room for maneuvering when a policy response is needed. Indeed, this argument may be related to the fact that countries which adopted inflation targeting set, in principle, a positive target for inflation, including the United Kingdom which has 2.5 percent inflation as a target.

However, careful examination seems warranted as to whether these discussions and the examples of foreign countries could be directly applied to Japan. In view of the fact that bonuses have fallen substantially and labor costs have been reduced by utilizing part-time workers and temporary employment agencies over the past one to two years, the downward rigidity of nominal wages in Japan's labor market may not be so strong as has been argued. The idea of tolerating a certain positive rate of inflation to ensure a cushion for monetary policy seems to be something like putting the cart before the horse. As you may know, Japan has had an average inflation rate of only slightly over one percent for nearly twenty years. Thus, it would need a very good reason to accept an inflation rate of 2 to 3 percent. At this juncture, we should carefully examine the content of price stability that best contributes to the sound development of the national economy by taking due account of the features and structure of Japan's economy.

Toward enhanced transparency of monetary policy
As I have just described, there seem to exist a number of difficult problems in applying inflation targeting to Japan in the way it is adopted in some foreign countries. As a matter of fact, not only the Bank of Japan but also the Federal Reserve Board and European Central Bank are cautious about adopting such a framework. Nevertheless, it is true that the Bank of Japan is keenly aware that the transparency of monetary policy should be further enhanced.

Since it is impossible to foresee the economic outlook with certainty, we can neither predetermine the timing of any future policy changes nor set mechanical criteria for deciding policy changes. In fact, even in countries adopting inflation targeting, there is no rule whereby the central bank automatically tightens monetary conditions if inflation hits a certain target rate. In any country, monetary policy is based on the central bank's judgment of future price developments, which are influenced by various factors such as demand at home and abroad, wages, oil prices, foreign exchange rates, and technological innovation. In the conduct of monetary policy, the central bank needs to make an overall judgment by examining the effects of all these factors on prices. In this sense, the overall judgment of the central bank is important regardless of whether a framework like inflation targeting is adopted or not. In other words, adoption of inflation targeting does not mean that people will be able to know in advance when and by how much the policy interest rate will be changed.

The transparency of monetary policy is, after all, nothing more than clarifying what monetary policy is aiming at, and disclosing, to the extent possible, the overall judgment of the central bank with respect to current and future economic and financial conditions. With respect to the former, the new Bank of Japan Law clearly stipulates that price stability is the objective of monetary policy. With respect to the latter, the Bank has been trying to explain its overall judgment as clearly as possible in its Monthly Report on Recent Economic and Financial Developments and minutes of Monetary Policy Meetings. Such disclosure is stipulated in the new Bank of Japan Law. We thus believe that the transparency of monetary policy has been considerably enhanced compared with the situation under the old law.

At the same time, we should be well aware that behind the heated discussion on inflation targeting, market participants and the public are calling for more transparency with respect to monetary policy. Truly, greater transparency is also important for the central bank from the viewpoint of the smooth transmission of policy effects. Furthermore, we recognize that it is an important mandate of the Bank of Japan to plainly explain our thinking on the conduct of monetary policy and price stability.

Bearing such recognition in mind, the Bank has decided to conduct a comprehensive study on the concept of price stability and issue a report by around summer. The issues for study include:

(a) our basic thinking regarding price stability,
(b) the measurement of prices, namely, issues regarding price indexes,
(c) the evaluation of recent price developments in Japan, and
(d) issues related to the numerical quantification of price stability.
Since I have often been asked about the relationship between this comprehensive study on price stability and the lifting of the zero interest rate policy, let me say a few words on this issue.

The comprehensive study that we have undertaken is intended to review our basic thinking regarding price stability with a view to enhancing the transparency of monetary policy over the long run. And it should be understood that it is independent from the current conduct of monetary policy. Hence, it is not directly related to such issues as the timing of lifting the zero interest rate policy or conditions which must be fulfilled for lifting such policy. In other words, it does not imply that the zero interest rate policy will not be lifted until the study is completed nor that it will be lifted once the study is completed.

Conditions for lifting the zero interest rate policy can be likened to those for a patient in a hospital coming out of the intensive care unit, while our basic study on price stability is similar to a medical study of how to maintain health and physical strength in normal times.

With respect to the condition for lifting the zero interest rate policy, we have clearly stated that we will maintain the current zero interest rate policy until deflationary concerns are dispelled.

4. Concluding Remarks: Until Deflationary Concerns Are Dispelled
I would like to conclude my remarks today by addressing the question of how we might decide that the economy has reached a stage where deflationary concerns have been dispelled.

What is of central concern in our conduct of monetary policy is to avoid a deflationary spiral, which is a vicious circle of price declines and recession. However, it is difficult to define this spiral by such simple figures as a certain percentage decline in CPI. To reiterate, we cannot necessarily conclude that a situation is deflationary solely from a negative inflation rate when the IT and distribution network revolutions are in full swing. To the contrary, even if inflation is level statistically, stagnant demand would indicate future declines in prices and corporate profits, which means that deflationary concerns have yet to be dispelled. Thus, price developments must be assessed together with underlying factors. Furthermore, the most important point when judging whether deflationary concerns are dispelled is to analyze whether there exists pressure for pernicious price declines stemming from shrinking demand or a widening output gap.

In other words, if we become confident that economic recovery is sustained and that the output gap continues to narrow, then we can say that deflationary concerns have been almost dispelled and Japan's economy could leave the intensive care unit. In this regard, we need to have clearer indication that the economy is on a self-sustained recovery path led by private demand, not by policy and external factors.

Private demand basically consists of household consumption and business fixed investment. While both are necessary for sustainable growth, business fixed investment is believed to play, in many cases, a more important role in giving impetus to a virtuous circle of a self-sustained recovery. Recently, the environment surrounding private demand has been gradually improving as evidenced by higher corporate profits and the improved sentiment of firms and consumers. It is crucial whether such improvement will lead to increased spending. The Bank of Japan will carefully monitor the economy with focus on the strength of private demand centering on business fixed investment.

Today, I have tried to share our thoughts with you on price stability and the conduct of monetary policy by referring to inflation policy and inflation targeting. As always, I would appreciate it if you would continue to give us your understanding and support.

Thank you for your attention.",,Positive,0.8728955984,,
"May 5, 2000","Remarks by Kazuo Ueda, Member of the Policy Board of the Bank of Japan, at the Geneva Conference on 'Asset Price Inflation: What to Do about It?' organized by the International Center for Monetary and Banking Studies and the CEPR on May 5, 2000","I assume that my role in this conference would be to discuss the Japanese experience on the relationship between asset prices and monetary policy during the last two decades or so. I am a bit hesitant in this role because the story is well-known.1 Hopefully there is something new in my remarks.

 See, for example, Ueda (1997) and Yamaguchi (1999).
The question I am supposed to address is: Was there anything wrong with Japanese monetary policy during this period, especially in relation to asset price movements? And, if so, why? It would be also nice if I could draw from the experience some general lessons for monetary policy making.

Let me briefly summarize some of the key features of the period. The sharp appreciation of the yen in the mid- to late 1980s through the economy into a mild recession. The Bank of Japan (BOJ) responded by cutting the discount rate five times between 1986 and 1987. The moves generated a quick recovery of the economy and a sharp rise in stock and land prices. The BOJ waited for about two years before started tightening in May 1989. It raised the discount rate five times until August 1990. Stock prices started to decline in early 1990 and were already down by about 50% by September 1990. Land prices started their descent in 1991 and are still declining now in 2000. The boom-bust cycle in asset prices generated the severe bad loan problem with serious negative effects on the economy. The 1990s became a lost decade for the Japanese financial industry and the economy.

Many critics argue that the expansionary policy in 1986-87 was overdone and the tightening in 1989-90 came too late. Let us for the moment follow this line of logic and consider why things went that way.

In a sense, the BOJ was responding too much to certain asset prices until around 1987, and not much to some others after then. In four of the five discount rate cuts in 1986-87, the BOJ officially acknowledged that concern over the deflationary impact of a higher yen on aggregate demand was an important factor behind the discount rate changes.

The concern by itself does not seem to have been a problem. The extent of the concern, however, was problematic. The same pattern was observed in the 1970s, especially in the early 1970s. The expansionary monetary policy at that time in response to a stronger yen led to a sharp rise in goods and service prices. Put simply, in the 1970s and 1980s, the BOJ seems to have been worrying too much about the deflationary effect of a higher yen on the economy and/or there were strong outside political forces on the BOJ to counteract such effects. Technically, it is not too difficult to find a significant coefficient on the exchange rate in the estimation of a policy reaction function of the BOJ even after controlling for something like expected inflation.2 This pattern played itself again in the mid- to late 1980s and probably made the monetary stimulus excessive.

2 See Ueda (1997), Table 9.4.
The BOJ, after the five consecutive cuts in the discount rate, sought ways to change the policy stance in the direction of putting more weight on avoiding future inflation. It in fact let short-term market rates go up in the summer of 1987, as the economy started to recover.

Then, however, came the Black Monday in October 1987. After that, there were no clear attempts to tighten for a while. Again, the BOJ was paying a lot of attention to movements in asset prices, this time a decline in foreign stock prices.

There was foreign pressure on Japan to maintain low interest rates. The pressure was evident in the communiqué issued after the Reagan-Nakasone and Reagan-Takeshita meetings in 1987 and 1988.

In 1988 other economies such as Germany started tightening. In Japan, the Nikkei 225 went above the pre-Black Monday level, real GDP was expanding at around 6%. The BOJ again sought ways to raise rates. But there were no friends. The reason was simple; inflation was not in sight. CPI inflation was only 0.7% in 1988.

In fact, there was optimism about Japan, its current account surplus, the Japanese style of management, and the increased presence of Japanese financial institutions in the world. People were pointing to increases in productivity. The managing director of the IMF arrived in Japan in February 1989 and said something like ""there was absolutely no fear of inflation. Japan should keep its current monetary policy stance and play the role of the monetary anchor for the world.""

Seeing some signs of inflation, the BOJ finally raised rates five times between May 1989 and August 1990. Did the moves come too late? It is difficult to answer the question. At least, one can say that the policy stance became somewhat backward-looking with no clear sign of inflation and no clear-cut recipe about how to respond to asset price inflation.

One could say, however, that there were no major mistakes on the inflation front. CPI inflation reached a peak in 1991 at only 3.3%. Though the judgment depends on one's view about the optimal inflation rate, not too many central banks would have done better on this front.

Those who are not satisfied with such an evaluation point to the serious bad-loan problem of the banking sector resulting from the boom-bust cycle in the stock and land markets, and its effect on the rest of the economy. There is an obvious point that the difficulty of the 1990s was mainly a result of the mishandling of the bad loan problem. Could a better monetary policy, however, have prevented the disaster of the 1990s from happening?

I do not think that inflation forecast targeting would have done it, if the forecast horizon was 1-2 years as is normally the case, for the reason I mentioned above.3 It would have been different with a much longer horizon such as ten years. BOJ officials in the late 1980s then would have thought about problems posed by the zero interest rate policy-a policy to be adopted ten years later to combat the deflationary forces stemming from the boom-bust cycle. To be so forward-looking is not easy, to say the least.

3Some adopters of inflation targeting, for example, the Bank of England, do not specify the time horizon for hitting the target. Formally, they attempt to hit the target at all times. It would be practically difficult, however, for central banks to have a long horizon of five to ten years in their inflation forecasts.
Another way out would have been to remember the historical lesson that a large boom-bust cycle in asset prices often leads to serious problems in the financial system with negative implications for the rest of the economy. In a sense this suggestion is similar to the first one above, but is more specific in its focus on the health of the financial system. It also leads to the view that the dividing line between monetary policy and prudential policy is not as clear-cut as some would argue. The problem with such a suggestion is, of course, it may result in an attempt to stop a healthy rise in asset prices.

A third way out might have been the Bernanke-Gertler solution.4 They argue that the BOJ should have increased the call rate in 1988 up to 8% or so against the actual of about 4%. But a quick reading of their analysis suggests that this conclusion is obtained because the Taylor rule, which they use to calculate the optimal call rate, suggests a rise in the rate in response to the sharp pickup in real economic activity then rather than to inflation. Raising rates just because real GDP is growing strongly but with no inflation is hard especially when favorable supply shocks are thought to be hitting the economy.

4 See Bernanke & Gertler (1999).
Thus, all these suggestions seem to be easier said than done.

What are the implications of the above discussion for the argument to set up a predetermined rule regarding the relationship between asset prices and policy instruments as seem to be claimed in the conference paper? In a sense, Japan failed by having something like this on the exchange rate as I argued. I hasten to add that more independence from outside forces would have helped the BOJ from acting in that way in the 1980s. In any case, it would be more important to analyze adequately what current asset price movements would mean for future inflation and GDP movements than to make policy instruments respond directly to asset prices.

In this sense I am close to the view of Bernanke and Gertler. As I pointed out above, however, one would require a very sophisticated version of inflation-forecast targeting, which either looks at a horizon of ten years or so, or at the delicate boundary between monetary and prudential policies. Or else, central banks need to be able to distinguish between supply shocks and demand shocks. In the end, optimal decision making under uncertainty would recommend some ""response"" to a sharp asset price inflation because of, to repeat, concern for future inflation stability. But the degree of the response would in no way be a pre-determined constant.",,Neutral,0.8211209774,,
"May 27, 2000","Speech given by Eiko Shinotsuka, Member of the Policy Board of the Bank of Japan, to the Japan Society of Monetary Economics on May 27, 2000 (Japan's Economy and the Role of the Bank of Japan)","The new Bank of Japan Law, which came into effect in April 1998, has given de jure independence to the Bank of Japan and stipulates that the Bank should improve the transparency of its decision-making process regarding monetary policy and other business operations. To this end, the Bank has been making efforts to provide the public with related information through a variety of channels such as press conferences, speeches, and its Web site in addition to publishing the minutes of Monetary Policy Meetings, which are, in principle, held twice a month. Furthermore, each member of the Policy Board has actively engaged in exchanging views with people in various fields to promote an understanding of monetary policy.

Today I would like to share my thoughts with you on the conduct of monetary policy viewed from some selected, though I think quite important, perspectives. First, I will look back on the experience of the emergence and bursting of the bubble economy since the late 1980s and try to summarize the lessons learned regarding the conduct of monetary policy. Then, bearing these lessons in mind, I will discuss some points of contention regarding the current zero interest rate policy. Finally, because I specialize in labor economics, I would like to present my views on the impact of monetary policy on income distribution.

I. Japan's Economy in the 1990s
With respect to Japan's economy, the 1990s are often referred to as ""the lost decade."" In fact, Japan experienced a recession during most of the 1990s. Though it may be too early to draw comprehensive conclusions regarding the background to the lost decade, it appears to me that two factors are worth mentioning in the context of my speech today, namely the bursting of the bubble and the structural problem.

A. The Bursting of the Bubble
One important factor behind the recession in the 1990s was the impact of the bursting of the bubble. A variety of reasons have been given to explain the emergence and expansion of the bubble, and among them I personally think that a chain reaction of expectations played an important role. In the late 1980s, bullish expectations that Japan's economic structure was undergoing changes that would raise its growth potential prevailed among almost all economic entities including firms, households, financial institutions, and the Government. And in the final days of the bubble, it seems that such expectations led to a kind of euphoria and the loss of self-control mechanisms.

However, it turned out that there were no such changes in Japan's economic structure that would raise its growth potential, the public came to realize that the bullish expectations were unfounded, and they had to be revised downward. As a result, economic activity rapidly lost vigor, which in turn led to a classical adjustment of capital stock.

At the same time, capital stock was significantly devalued. Among the capital stock accumulated during the bubble period in anticipation of capital gains and demand expansion were facilities such as luxury resort hotels on remote islands. In the end, they lost their economic value almost completely because there was little likelihood of their being utilized and conversion to alternative use was too costly.

Such an enormous amount of negative stock had a serious adverse impact on economic activity through a deterioration in the financial intermediary function. A drop in asset prices impaired the asset quality of both borrowers and lenders, thereby reducing the value of their capital base. Since capital base is a cushion for possible losses in the future, there was a strong possibility that economic entities experiencing a reduced capital base would become cautious in their own risk taking and also find it difficult to maintain business relations when trading partners demanded a higher risk premium. In particular, the ability of financial institutions to extend credit declined substantially because of the heavy devaluation of collateral such as property and securities. This had the effect of significantly restraining the spending of the private sector.

B. The Structural Problem
Another factor was the structural problem that was temporarily concealed by the emergence and bursting of the bubble. I think one of the reasons why we still have difficulty in drawing clear conclusions about the factors behind the prolonged recession in Japan in the 1990s, is that the structural problem was intertwined with the adverse impact of the bursting of the bubble.

Here I would like to discuss the structural problem in the context that an economic system that was well-adapted to high growth has become untenable due to the decline in Japan's growth potential with the maturing of the economy.

For instance, the low productivity and profitability of Japanese firms are often pointed out as one of the economy's structural problems. This is partly attributable to the decline in the average productivity of capital, that is, a decrease in capital efficiency, resulting from the fact that capital has been accumulated while growth of the workforce has slowed down. It is also attributable to a loss of balance between labor productivity and wages. The employment system in Japan was underpinned by a belief in ever-rising economic growth and the pyramid-like corporate structure with younger workers at the bottom of the pyramid. However, as older workers have come to dominate the workforce in a situation of low economic growth, labor's share of national income has risen and corporate profits have been squeezed.

Non-manufacturing industry in particular has exhibited relatively low productivity because price competition through new entry has been restrained to a large extent. As a result, domestic service prices in Japan have been high by international comparison. This, in turn, has weakened the international competitiveness of the manufacturing industry, which has to depend on these domestic services.

These structural problems do not necessarily have a direct bearing on the bubble. But perhaps we can say that a substantial drop in the ability of firms to adapt to changes in the management environment during the process of the bursting of the bubble may have amplified the negative impact generated by these structural problems.

C. Lessons Learned from the Bubble in Relation to the Conduct of Monetary Policy
As I have described, the bursting of the bubble was without doubt a major factor, if not the sole factor, behind Japan's recession in the 1990s. Therefore, we should conduct monetary policy paying due attention to the lessons learned from the bubble economy. In this regard, let me outline, while referring from time to time to the recent study on a similar topic by my colleagues at the Bank,1 four important lessons that I always keep in mind.

Monetary policy that incorporates risk scenarios
The first and most important lesson often pointed out is the importance of conducting monetary policy in a preemptive manner. I might rephrase this as the importance of ""monetary policy that incorporates risk scenarios.""

The bubble in Japan expanded based on the strong bullish expectations that asset prices would keep rising, and, in this sense, monetary easing was only one of the factors behind the expansion of the bubble. As such bullish expectations led to speculative activity, monetary easing facilitated its financing. Indeed, if we examine the yield curve at the time, it suggests that, despite growing evidence of economic expansion, expectations prevailed in financial and capital markets that interest rates would remain low and funds could continue to be raised almost without limit. Prolonged monetary easing, with the official discount rate kept as low as 2.5 percent for 27 months from February 1987 through May 1989, was definitely a necessary condition for the bubble to emerge, though not a sufficient condition. As a lesson derived from this experience, the importance of preemptive monetary policy, in other words the importance of forward-looking monetary policy, is now widely recognized.

It is by no means an easy task to conduct monetary policy in a forward-looking manner bearing in mind future inflation and the possible risk of a bubble. The emergence and expansion of a bubble have a seemingly favorable influence on an economy, and at least initially have no tangible adverse impact, though serious problems will surface when it eventually bursts. An upward shift in the expected growth rate could be triggered by either a bubble or technological innovation, and would initially bring about favorable economic conditions. In other words, when we observe the initial stage of favorable economic conditions, it is difficult to tell whether they reflect a bubble or such factors as technological innovation and changes in the economic structure.

This kind of problem of identification is not limited to the bubble period in Japan. It appears that the Fed currently faces a similar problem. It may be the case that the current expansion of the U.S. economy is based on revolutionary technological innovation as postulated in the so-called ""new economy."" And, it is natural that economic growth potential will rise if monetary policy is kept neutral. However, if the Fed should judge there is a bubble-like situation and tightens monetary policy, growth potential would instead be suppressed. On the other hand, the expansion might be a little bit bubble-like in the sense that asset prices in the market overestimate the rise in future productivity. In this case, if the Fed disregards this overestimation and maintains a neutral monetary policy stance, then there would be a risk that the economy might face a bursting of the bubble and severe adjustment when the overestimation is eventually rectified. How then should monetary policy be conducted?

Some may argue that a close examination of the economic situation could solve the problem by preventing such misjudgment. Though both the Bank of Japan and the Fed have been striving to systematically analyze the economic and financial situation, central banks are not much wiser than the market and I do not think close examination alone can solve the problem. Of course, we cannot go to the extreme of disregarding all information, including the impact of technological innovation, that is taken into account in the market. Therefore, at every Monetary Policy Meeting, I always try to make the best decision based on all the information available while paying due attention to the limitations. In this regard, I believe it is important in the conduct of monetary policy to focus on minimizing future risks to the Japanese economy.

Why did the Bank of Japan maintain monetary easing so long? Perhaps because the Bank might not have been sufficiently aware that the bursting of the bubble would have very serious negative effects on Japan's economy, as has been witnessed, through such channels as balance sheet adjustment and instability of the financial system. With the benefit of hindsight, we may have been slightly short on awareness of the risk scenario involved.

Changes in asset prices
The second lesson in conducting monetary policy is that we should pay due attention to changes in asset prices and their impact on the economy. This does not mean that the objective of monetary policy is to control asset prices. Even if the Bank of Japan were to attempt to control asset prices, it would most likely end up with the situation where fluctuations in the economy would be greatly amplified.

Movements in asset prices affect monetary policy in a variety of ways. Asset prices, be they a bubble or not, contain valuable information about market expectations of the economic outlook. Market expectations include various factors that will determine the future course of the economy including prospective policy actions of the Bank of Japan. The Bank should thus pay close attention to such information and the impact stemming from changes in asset prices when implementing monetary policy.

Furthermore, a rise in asset prices such as stocks and property would increase aggregate demand. It would raise the amount of funds available to borrowers by increasing the net worth of firms and the value of collateral. It would also increase spending through the wealth effect.

In addition, there is a possibility that large fluctuations in asset prices could significantly impair the soundness of the financial system which is the infrastructure on which all economic activity is based and which also serves as a conduit for the transmission mechanism of monetary policy. It is still fresh in our memory that concern over financial system stability in the autumn of 1997 exacerbated the disruption of the economy.

Choice of appropriate policy measures
The third lesson is the importance of appropriately choosing policy measures. In retrospect, we notice something like a puzzle in the conduct of monetary policy in the late 1980s. In the spring of 1987, the Bank of Japan lowered the official discount rate from 3 percent to 2.5 percent. And, at the same time, in its window guidance it urged commercial banks to maintain a prudent lending attitude in view of the rise in asset prices and the excessive investment in stocks and property. This suggests that people in the Bank clearly recognized the upside risk to the economy at the time when they lowered the official discount rate. Why did the Bank of Japan have to take such contrary policy actions? The answer appears to me that the Bank was forced to make a compromise under the pressure of the then prevailing policy agenda, that is, international policy coordination.

During the bubble period, international policy coordination was often used as rhetoric to force other countries to make adjustments that should have been first dealt with by macroeconomic policy at home. Furthermore, there was a strong deep-rooted feeling against the appreciation of the yen in Japan at the time. Newspaper editorials and articles repeatedly told us that as the world's largest creditor, Japan had a responsibility to maintain low interest rates and also that to raise the official discount rate might cause a worldwide recession, so it would be difficult to do so as long as stock prices were unstable. Though the Bank was becoming aware of the risk inherent in the bubble economy as early as the spring of 1987, public opinion calling for continuing monetary easing was getting stronger. Then came the Black Monday crash in October 1987. Given the circumstances, the Bank had to place priority on a policy agenda of international policy coordination, prevention of the yen's appreciation, and reduction of the current account surplus through the expansion of domestic demand. In this regard, former Governor of the Bank of Japan Yasushi Mieno said, looking back on the experience, that monetary policy should aim at equilibrium of the domestic economy, more specifically achieving non-inflationary sustainable growth over the long run, and not at exchange rate stability and the adjustment of external imbalances.2

I think there were two factors underlying the difficulty the Bank had at the time in conducting appropriate monetary policy: the weak legal foundation for central bank independence, and the nature of expectations that cannot be easily changed once embedded in society. The Bank of Japan at that time asserted that despite the absence of a strong legal basis, central bank independence was firmly respected under a tacit understanding of parties concerned. However, it seems doubtful how independently the Bank conducted monetary policy under the old Bank of Japan Law, where the Minister of Finance had comprehensive supervisory power over the Bank. For example, the public auction system for issuing financing bills, which was not realized under the old Bank of Japan Law, was finally introduced under the new Law enacted in 1998.

As I stated at the outset, the new Bank of Japan Law has given de jure independence to the Bank, but we still encounter in various forms the problem that expectations once embedded in society cannot easily be changed. For example, even though the G-7 statement of April this year only confirmed the fact that the Bank would continue the zero interest rate policy which was decided at the Monetary Policy Meeting immediately before the G-7, we saw reports saying that the inclusion of such a phrase indicated that other G-7 members disapproved of early termination of the zero interest rate policy. The G-7 meeting is a forum of finance ministers and central bank governors of seven industrialized countries for exchanging views and sharing understanding of economic developments in participating countries and the world. If, however, there is such a misconception that the future course of monetary policy is agreed upon at G-7 meetings, it would certainly be incorporated in the price formation of the marketplace. Even though such expectations would be founded on a misconception, the market would be disrupted if the expectations were somehow not fulfilled, and the Bank of Japan would be criticized for such disruption. This confusion that we observed around the time of the Monetary Policy Meeting of September last year can be understood in a similar light. How the central bank should respond to price formation based on misconception is an extremely tricky problem. The Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland raised a similar problem that it called the ""expectations trap"" in its Annual Report for 1998.3

For a correct understanding of the goal of monetary policy and the thinking behind its implementation, I believe that the Bank should do its utmost to correct expectations based on misconceptions embedded in the market even if the Bank temporarily comes under strong criticism.

Disclosure of information
The fourth lesson is the significance of improving transparency with respect to the conduct of monetary policy, in other words, the importance of information disclosure. Though I have just said that the Bank must correct misconceptions embedded in the market even if we are temporarily criticized, it is certainly better to communicate with the market without causing unnecessary disruption. Under the new Bank of Japan Law, independence has certainly been enhanced, but it does not mean that the Bank can go its own way in conducting monetary policy without paying any attention to public opinion. The highest body of national sovereignty is the legislature, which is the Diet in Japan. The legislative body in many industrial countries, including Japan, has given independence to the central bank because of historical experience that teaches that significant harm would be done to society in the long run if monetary policy decisions were affected by various political interests. In this sense, central bank independence can be regarded as discipline that society has imposed on itself.

Central bank independence as the self-discipline of society should not be taken lightly. It is, therefore, indispensable that the Bank should explain to the extent possible central bank independence and the decision-making process of monetary policy so that the public has a correct understanding. At the same time, each member of the Policy Board has the responsibility to disclose his/her judgment on economic and financial conditions as well as his/her thinking on the conduct of monetary policy.

Currently, the Bank discloses discussions at Monetary Policy Meetings through the minutes and other publications. Unlike the Fed and the Bank of England, whose minutes mostly describe the majority view, the minutes of the Bank of Japan give a detailed description of not only the majority view but also the minority view. Such disclosure, I believe, would not have been possible without the revision of the Bank of Japan Law. It is a big ""if,"" but if in 1987 the Bank had enjoyed strong independence as it does today and the minority view of the Policy Board had been disclosed under the principle of transparency, it might have been the case that the public would have been aware of the risk of a bubble and its expansion would thus have been prevented at an early stage.

II. On the Zero Interest Rate Policy
A. Overview
The zero interest rate policy, which the Bank of Japan has maintained since February 1999, consists of two elements. First, the unsecured overnight call rate has been guided to virtually zero percent through monetary operations. Under this policy, the Bank is prepared to provide as much liquidity as needed and to satisfy all demand for short-term funds so as to drive the overnight call rate down to zero percent.

Second, the Bank has made clear its commitment to maintain the zero interest policy until deflationary concerns have been dispelled, implying that the policy will continue beyond the following Monetary Policy Meeting if necessary, so that the effects can thoroughly permeate financial markets.

Some economists have criticized the phrase ""until deflationary concerns have been dispelled"" as being ambiguous and unclear as to how long the policy will continue. It is, however, extremely difficult to make a commitment to specify how long the current policy will continue when there exists much uncertainty regarding future economic and financial developments. Indeed, neither those central banks that have adopted inflation targeting nor the Fed and European Central Bank have gone so far as to make commitments about policy interest rates beyond the next monetary policy meeting.

Others have called upon the Bank to specify the condition that has to be satisfied for deflationary concerns to be dispelled. In this regard, as you can see in the minutes of recent Monetary Policy Meetings, the condition has been gradually boiled down to whether a self-sustained recovery of private demand can be seen. Since we had grave concerns over a variety of serious downside risks when we adopted the zero interest rate policy in February 1999, it was impossible for us to specify the condition needed to dispel deflationary concerns at the time.

In retrospect, it seems that the zero interest rate policy was adopted when the economy and financial markets were affecting each other in an extremely negative manner. In financial markets at the time, there was a strong possibility that the very pessimistic view of Japan's economy falling into a crisis would become widespread. Had the view spread to households and firms, such economic activity as household consumption and business fixed investment would have been excessively depressed and the economy would have fallen into a vicious circle. In response to this situation, the Bank of Japan announced its strong commitment to monetary easing by adopting the zero interest rate policy. The Government injected public funds into 15 major banks at the end of March 1999 under the Law Concerning Emergency Measures for the Reconstruction of the Function of the Financial System and the Financial Function Early Strengthening Law, both of which were enacted in October 1998. The combined effect of these policies has drastically reduced concern about financial system stability. I believe that we, as the central bank, made the maximum possible commitment required at the time when we adopted the zero interest rate policy in February 1999.

B. Termination of the Zero Interest Rate Policy
When making a decision regarding monetary policy, we always weigh the positive and negative effects in analyzing economic and financial conditions. The zero interest rate policy is no exception. Though the majority of the Policy Board maintains that the zero interest rate policy should continue, they do not totally ignore the negative effects of the policy. Indeed, the Policy Board as a whole has decided that priority should be placed on supporting economic activity through low interest rates in view of the deflationary concerns still remaining, while paying due attention to the negative effects of the current policy. I am a proponent of the minority view that the zero interest rate policy should be lifted and the overnight call rate raised to the level before the change on February 12, 1999. But, I do not focus solely on the negative effects. I fully appreciate that the current zero interest rate policy has greatly contributed to financial market stability and the economic recovery. I do not think that my view of the basic framework for the conduct of monetary policy is significantly different from that of the majority. The difference in opinion arises because of increasing uncertainties regarding the economic outlook. It would thus seem only natural that the evaluation of economic conditions currently differs to a certain extent among the members of the Policy Board.

Bearing in mind the most recent judgment that the improvement in Japan's economy is becoming more marked with a recovery being observed in some areas of private demand, let me talk about three issues relating to the termination of the zero interest rate policy.

Have deflationary concerns been dispelled?
The first and most important issue is whether we have come to the point where we can say deflationary concerns have been dispelled.

Let me digress a little by briefly discussing what deflationary concerns are and what is really meant by price stability. Though there are a variety of points to discuss regarding price stability, which is the target of monetary policy, I would like to take up three that I think important. First, price stability is a precondition for sustainable growth, and such stability is required not temporarily but over the long run.

Second, theoretically the Bank should aim at zero inflation, since inflation would cause a deterioration in the allocation of resources through changes in relative prices, the distortion of income distribution, and increased uncertainty that would prevent economic entities from efficiently conducting their activities. However, given that price indices such as the Consumer Price Index and GDP deflator have biases, price stability compatible with sustainable growth does not necessarily mean a zero percent increase in terms of particular price indices.

The third point is how to deal with supply shocks. One view is that it is not persuasive to talk about price stability while excluding particular products whose prices have changed due to a supply shock since monetary policy aims at stability of the general price level. It would be difficult for monetary policy to control the impact of supply shocks. If monetary policy were to try to control such impacts, it is likely that sustainable price stability would be impaired as production swings became larger and uncertainty regarding investment increased. Therefore, we should accept change in prices due to supply shocks to a certain extent. At the same time, we should closely monitor the risk that a drastic change in the relationship between costs and prices due to supply shocks might affect corporate profits, subsequently leading to large swings in economic activity.

Again there is the problem of identification in that it is not easy to clearly tell supply shocks from demand shocks. Though we do not have a perfect solution to this difficult problem, we do our best by combining macroeconomic analysis and information on the microeconomic level that is collected by both the Head Office and branches.

Now let me return to the zero interest rate policy. The Bank has clearly stated that it will continue the current zero interest rate policy until deflationary concerns have been dispelled. The term ""deflationary concerns"" refers to concerns about the economy falling into a deflationary spiral, that is, a vicious circle where a decline in prices suppresses economic activity through lower corporate profits and wages, which in turn causes a further decline in prices. If a decline in prices reflects technological innovation and improved efficiency of corporate management that increase production without unduly squeezing profits, such a decline would not give rise to deflationary concerns since a positive momentum is working on economic activity.

In judging whether deflationary concerns have been dispelled, we need to accurately assess the momentum of economic activity or the strength of the self-sustained recovery behind price developments. Specifically, we need to check three points regarding the self-sustained recovery of private demand: First, is corporate activity gathering positive momentum? Second, to what extent is the improvement in corporate activity leading to an improvement in household income and employment? And third, how smoothly is the improvement in household income and employment leading to increased private consumption? With these three questions in mind, the Bank has been carefully examining economic data to confirm whether deflationary concerns have been dispelled. Currently, the Bank is examining private consumption. To be more specific, we have been trying to judge whether household income and the propensity to consume, both of which are underlying factors of private consumption, have stopped deteriorating and are beginning to show any signs of improvement. As firms will continue squeezing labor costs over the medium term, a conspicuous increase in household income can hardly be expected. Nevertheless, we expect that the environment surrounding private consumption will improve if firms become more active, corporate profits increase, and the expected economic growth rate rises. Such a view is shared by a majority of Policy Board members, including myself.

Assuming that the recovery has become more distinct, we should pay more attention to the development of money supply to judge whether it is still appropriate to continue providing ample liquidity. Let me elaborate on this.

Since a change in money supply usually precedes one in economic activity, I take money supply as an information variable. The most important feature of money supply is its comprehensiveness. Though a change in money supply does not correspond to changes in any specific economic variables, it generally reflects the development of overall economic activity. According to empirical research by the staff of the Bank,4 there is a long-term stable relationship between money supply and such variables as the general price level and nominal GDP. Another feature is that since a change in money supply precedes one in economic activity, significant fluctuations in money supply most likely signal an underlying change of economic activity.

It is difficult to predict how such an underlying change will reveal itself--it may be a fluctuation in economic activity, a change in prices, or volatility of asset prices as evidenced in the bubble period. In some cases, it is hard at an early stage to detect signs of an underlying change of economic activity that has already occurred. Furthermore, since it is not easy to predict the impact of a change in money supply on economic activity, it is rather misleading to assume a strict relationship such as that prices will change if the growth rate of money supply diverges from its long-term equilibrium trend for more than a year. In conducting monetary policy, we need to be on the lookout for any underlying changes of economic activity every time monetary aggregates show volatile movement.

In 1999, the year-on-year growth rate of nominal GDP was minus 0.6 percent while the growth rate of money supply was 3.6 percent and that of the monetary base 7.3 percent. Thus, we cannot say that the supply of money was insufficient relative to economic activity. Since 1997, Marshallian k, which is the ratio of M2+CDs outstanding to nominal GDP, has been significantly above the long-term trend calculated from the 1970s. Both broadly-defined liquidity and modified Marshallian k that uses ""divisia money supply"" have also shown similar movements.

Marshallian k surged from 1997 onward because precautionary demand for money at firms and households increased, reflecting concern over possible funding difficulties against the background of financial system instability. Since the increase in money supply due to precautionary demand is not related to economic activity, such an increase should be discounted when evaluating the movement of Marshallian k.

As a recovery becomes pronounced, there will be less incentive to hold money for precautionary reasons and the opportunity cost of holding money will increase along with interest rates. As a result, Marshallian k will decline. Though it may sound paradoxical, when economic conditions become such that termination of the zero interest rate policy is warranted, money supply outstanding adjusted for inflation needs to decline to a certain extent. Also, the money multiplier may increase as the financial intermediary function recovers. In the process of economic recovery, there will eventually be a turning point with respect to the movement of money supply. This should be always borne in mind, as we might otherwise make a serious mistake. For example, if we continue to believe, without much evidence, that the increase in Marshallian k reflects greater precautionary demand for money, we might miss the turning point, and excessive fluctuation in economic activity would likely occur.

I do not maintain that inflationary risks are in the offing. The zero interest rate policy is very powerful in the sense that theoretically there is no limit to the provision of liquidity. It will become even more powerful as concern over financial system stability recedes and the economy recovers further. So, if the Bank continues to provide liquidity in the same way as it does now, economic activity might be excessively stimulated and there may be a risk of impairing stable growth over the medium to long term. In today's uncertain environment, the Bank must adopt a preemptive and gradual approach in the conduct of monetary policy by taking stock of our past experience as well as the experience of foreign central banks.

Having said all this, some may criticize me strongly, saying that what matters is that there had not been enough monetary easing. It seems that those in favor of further monetary easing argue that Japan has already experienced, or has been on the verge of falling into, severe deflation similar to that during the Great Depression in the United States in the 1930s. As I have repeatedly stated, Japan's economy is clearly on a recovery path, and I do not think current economic conditions call for further monetary easing.

Can we lift the zero interest rate policy in a persuasive manner?
The second issue regarding the termination of the zero interest rate policy is how we can avoid shocks to financial markets, or at least, minimize them. Some economists argue that the zero interest rate policy could continue as long as there are no signs of inflationary risks. I fear that if we terminate the zero interest rate policy after observing some signs of inflationary risks, say for example raising the overnight call rate to 0.25 percent, strong expectations would arise in financial markets that the overnight call rate would be raised further from 0.25 percent, which would increase uncertainty regarding the future movement of interest rates.

On the contrary, if the Bank comprehensively explains its judgment that the economy has definitely improved since February 1999 when it was on the verge of falling into a deflationary spiral and that no signs of inflationary risks have been observed, and if it terminates the zero interest rate policy in line with the pace of recovery, I suspect that the shock of policy change will be relatively small.

In this regard, we may be able to draw a lesson from U.S. monetary policy in the early 1990s. In February 1994, the Fed raised its target for the federal funds rate from 3 percent to 3.25 percent for the first time in five years, thereby terminating the zero-percent real interest rate policy. As there were no clear signs of inflation at the time, and lingering concern over unemployment, the Fed released a statement saying that the decision had been taken to move toward a less accommodative monetary policy stance in view of the expansion of the economy.

After the increase in the federal funds rate in February 1994, long-term interest rates in the United States, which had been declining substantially, started to surge. But we should not jump to the conclusion that termination of the zero interest rate policy in Japan would give a serious shock to the market, including a surge in long-term interest rates. In general, the impact on the market of a change in monetary policy differs greatly, depending on how well market participants understand and share the central bank's thinking behind monetary policy and its judgment of the economy. There were strong expectations at the time in U.S. financial markets that the Fed would not raise the federal funds rate in the near future in light of the level of unemployment, which was a hot issue politically and socially. It seems that the policy stance of the Fed, to preemptively move toward a less accommodative stance before inflation arose, was not sufficiently understood in the market. Bearing in mind this experience of the Fed, it is quite important for the Bank to explain to the public, to the fullest extent possible, its judgment regarding the outlook for economic activity and prices as well as the relationship between monetary policy and such economic conditions.

Weakened awareness of risks
The third issue is the possibility that the awareness of risks among economic entities might be greatly weakened if the zero interest rate policy persists for a long time.

In fact, some market participants link deflationary concerns to structural adjustment and argue that the zero interest rate policy should continue as long as there are pressures for structural adjustment. I understand that pressures for structural adjustment would slow the pace of a self-sustained recovery of the economy. However, as I mentioned earlier, policy measures should be appropriately chosen for the objective that it is intended to achieve. Monetary easing has the side effect of alleviating the pain in the process of structural adjustment, but at the same time it makes economic entities delay adopting radical solutions to structural problems. If the zero interest rate policy continues while the economy is recovering, it may be natural for firms to fall into comfortable belief that they should postpone painful structural adjustment based on a short-sighted and false assumption that economic recovery can be supported solely by monetary policy. I feel it is vital we remind ourselves that the protracted monetary easing amid economic recovery was one of the major factors behind the expansion of the bubble.

III. Monetary Policy and Income Distribution
I have long supported the view that distortion of income distribution is one of the side effects of the zero interest rate policy. A textbook theory teaches us that the goal of monetary policy is price stability and that any distortion of income distribution should be corrected by fiscal policy and other income redistribution policies, though the influence of monetary policy on income distribution cannot be denied. I understand this theory, but still I cannot help feeling that the impact of monetary policy on income distribution has been taken too lightly.

The Bank explains the impact of the extremely low interest rate policy on households as follows. The extremely low interest rate policy reduces the interest income of households, while it improves employment and household income conditions through larger corporate profits. Statistically speaking, employee income accounts for about 80 percent of household disposable income, whereas interest and other income accounts for only about 5 percent. Therefore, on a net basis, if one compares employee income and interest income, households enjoy a positive effect from the extremely low interest rate policy.

This explanation by the Bank of Japan is based on a macroeconomic approach in the sense that various types of households with diverse interests are represented by employees' households, or the ""average"" households. This view is reasonable to the extent that monetary policy is a macroeconomic policy. However, household conditions are now very diverse, and they are expected to become even more so in the future. In light of this trend and the fact that the Bank has pursued an extremely low interest rate policy for the past five years, currently in the form of the zero interest rate policy, I fear that the Bank's explanation, which seems to give the impression that the impact of monetary policy on income distribution has been taken lightly, is unlikely to be fully accepted by the public.

In the conduct of monetary policy, the situation in which each household is placed must be taken as a given condition, including wages and salaries, assets and liabilities, and their ratio to annual income. Monetary policy has a different impact on different households, and it is impossible to conduct it in such a way as to adjust such asymmetry. Of course, it cannot be used to influence such factors as education and employment opportunities as well as risk taking. I do not agree to a priori arguments that income distribution should always be equal. Nor do I think that equality in results should be guaranteed.

Having said this, it is true that increasing attention is being paid to income differentials as can be seen in the controversy regarding this problem among young Japanese labor economists: many of them argue that the conventional approach of monitoring only the average household should be reconsidered. Recently, there is a microeconomic view of labor economics that holds that the zero interest rate policy is deeply related to the income distribution between winners and losers. As a specialist in labor economics, I tend to have sympathy with these views. Nevertheless, I can assure you is that I have, and for that matter the Bank has, never made a monetary policy decision based on weighing the opinions of winners and losers. This dilemma can be regarded as an example of the large gap between the macroeconomic approach, which is the basis of the conduct of monetary policy, and the microeconomic approach featured in labor economics.

Let me briefly describe how a foreign central bank explains the impact of monetary policy on income distribution. In the United States, the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City held a symposium in 1998 focusing on income inequality.5 In March this year, Mr. Greenspan, Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, referred to income distribution in a speech entitled ""Economic Challenges in the New Century"" to the effect that the remarkable performance of the U.S. economy in recent years has not reversed the wage inequality that occurred during the 1980s but has brought benefits to minorities as seen in the increase in their asset holdings and the rise in home ownership. I think that we should be aware that the Fed, as the central bank, has been paying careful attention to such problems as the impact of monetary policy on income distribution and the change in national income distribution. Such an approach may be based on the fact that the United States is a multi-racial country and its public authorities always have to pay careful attention to problems like the difference between the rich and the poor to preserve social stability. Nevertheless, we can certainly draw a lesson from such an approach.

Let me turn the focus back to Japan. Among the general public, there seems to exist in some quarters an illusion that households have nothing to do with macroeconomic policy. For example, when the Tokyo Metropolitan Government introduced a plan for a new tax on selected large financial institutions operating in Tokyo, many Tokyo residents agreed with it. However, it is doubtful whether many fundamental issues related to the tax plan had been thoroughly examined, for example, the impact of the plan on the profitability of banks operating in Tokyo, especially major banks that have received public funds, and the impact on the international competitiveness of the Tokyo market and on financial system stability. Should this policy decision lead to a deterioration in the international competitiveness of the Tokyo market and instability of the financial system, it might be that Tokyo residents would have to bear the cost as taxpayers.

I think it is the household sector that ultimately bears risks in any country.6 Therefore, the people are entitled to appropriate information to enable them to make a correct assessment of a variety of problems, the risk attaching to which they have to bear or will have to in the future, including the financial system problem, the management of fiscal policy, and other economic policy issues. The central bank also has a responsibility to provide the public with an adequate explanation regarding the conduct of monetary policy. It should pay more careful attention to the impact of monetary policy on income distribution. I personally would like to study further how to make the best use of the microeconomic approach in labor economics in conducting monetary policy.

IV. Conclusion: The Bank of Japan in the 21st Century
Today, dialogue with the market is essential to the conduct of monetary policy. To me, the market here means the public. As the financial market expands in depth and breadth, the distinction between professionals and laymen in financial activity has become blurred. I believe that to enhance public confidence in monetary policy, the Bank should become a central bank that can share its various concerns with the public.

Recently, inflation targeting has received much attention from the viewpoint of the framework of monetary policy. It is pointed out that it would improve communication between policy makers and the public, and strengthen discipline and accountability.7 The new Bank of Japan Law has firmly established a basic principle of transparency that is inseparable from independence. And, under this principle, the Bank has been maintaining accountability that is totally comparable with the Fed and other central banks that have adopted inflation targeting, through publication of the minutes of Monetary Policy Meetings and the Monthly Report of Economic and Financial Developments.

I hasten to add that I do not think the current style of conduct of monetary policy is faultless. For example, we should be open to learning what we can learn from countries that have adopted inflation targeting. For example, we could examine the possibility of disclosing our inflation forecast or the economic outlook behind this forecast. A comprehensive study on price stability that includes this issue is currently under way.

The central bank can only earn credibility through daily implementation of appropriate monetary policy. In June 1943, Mr. Keizo Shibusawa, the then Deputy Governor and later the 16th Governor of the Bank, stated in his speech at the inaugural meeting of the Japan Society of Monetary Economics that: ""When tackling a new problem, it is vital to properly understand how it has emerged. A correct fundamental theory is essential to appropriate policy and its implementation.""8 More than fifty years have passed, but this message is still valid today. I hope all of you will continue to give us candid advice and criticism with respect to monetary policy.",,Positive,0.8461053967,,
"May 29, 2000","Governor's Speech on May 29, 2000 (Revitalization of Japan's Economy)","I had opportunities to speak on the structural problems facing Japan's economy and the medium to long-term issues which needed to be addressed. And, on each occasion, I emphasized that for Japan to achieve a full-fledged recovery, not only support from policy measures but also private sector vitality in the form of 'creative destruction', were of critical importance. As Japan's economy has recently been showing clearer signs of improvement, we have witnessed earnest efforts toward structural reform being set in motion in various areas of the economy. Bearing in mind such a development, today I would like to talk about the issues which are considered important to Japan's economy at the moment.

1. Recent Economic Developments and Structural Adjustment
Current state of the economy
Let me start by giving our view on the current state of the economy. The improvement in Japan's economy is becoming distinct. And, recovery has been observed in some areas of private demand as witnessed by business fixed investment continuing to increase gradually. Looking back to around this time last year, it is true that some economic indicators had already begun to show signs of recovery. Such a recovery was brought about by an increase in public investment and favorable developments in overseas economies, and was far from being a self-sustained recovery led by domestic private demand.

To the contrary, the recent improvement has been accompanied by a recovery in private demand centering on a moderate increase in business fixed investment, and deflationary concerns have gradually subsided, although private consumption, which is a major component of private demand, still remains short of what one would call a recovery. Granted that private consumption is unlikely to return to the high growth of the 1980s because of the declining growth potential of Japan's economy over the long run, and given that consumer sentiment has been gradually improving, the key to the outlook for private consumption will be the impact of increased production and higher corporate profits on household income. With this in mind, we continue to carefully monitor the economic situation.

Business cycle and structural adjustment
While the economy is on a recovery path, we observe that structural problems have not yet been solved. Since such an observation leads to controversy over the relation between the business cycle and structural adjustment, allow me to elaborate a little.

It is not correct to say that the economy will never recover unless structural problems are solved. Needless to say, some kind of structural problems always exist at any point in time in any economy, and I do not deny that Japan currently faces extremely big problems. Moreover, it should be remembered that at the same time we also experience business cycles. On the other hand, it is not correct to claim that an economic recovery has nothing to do with structural problems. If structural reform does not proceed smoothly, economic recovery will lack strength, or big problems will remain unsolved even after the economy recovers substantially as evidenced by the situation in Japan after the bursting of the bubble. I think it true to say that economic recovery would be all the more robust if accompanied by the progress of structural reform.

The nature of structural problems may differ from time to time and from country to country, and it is not easy to come up with a clear-cut definition. Having said this, the current structural problems in Japan could be characterized as arising from the process of the economic system adapting to a new environment, in other words, it is a problem that has contained the dynamism of the Japanese economy. Indeed, changes in the economic environment in the 1990s such as the progress of information and telecommunications technology and the globalization of market economies had a substantial impact on Japanese firms in persuading them to change. The aftereffects of the bursting of the bubble can also be recognized as a structural problem in that they prevented firms and financial institutions from adapting to the change in the environment by eroding their financial strength.

Significant changes in the environment can make an existing economic system obsolete and reduce profitability of the corporate sector. Particularly when the magnitude of change is large and firms are uncertain as to how to adapt, many initially tend to be defensive in their response by reducing investment and employment, which only leads to further downward pressure on the economy. In the process of cost reduction, however, firms that recover profitability and discover ways to adapt to the new environment will gradually increase in number. Then, the way a firm overcomes structural problems itself will become a source of new growth. This is the stage where firms take the offensive in that they implement comprehensive reform of their management system geared toward the new environment and invest in strategically important areas or new businesses. Though even at this stage there will exist not a few firms which are still defensive, the overall picture is that the economy will recover as structural reform progresses. And, as the number of firms taking the offensive increases, the economy will eventually shift to a full-fledged recovery path.

Characteristics of economic recovery under structural adjustment
Currently, it is our judgment that Japan's economy is at the stage where the number of firms taking the offensive has started increasing, that is, the economy is moderately recovering parallel with structural adjustment. Let me point out some of the major characteristics of this recovery.

First, the recovery has been led by the corporate sector. In the 1990s, the prolonged recession and slow adjustment of employment and wages under the prevailing management system led to a substantial rise in the proportion of labor income to national income, which was one factor behind the deteriorating profitability of Japanese firms. Putting aside the effects of active monetary and fiscal policy as well as steady developments in overseas economies, the current recovery is, to a large extent, triggered by the earnest restructuring of Japanese firms with the aim of restoring profitability. Thus, with respect to the recovery of private demand, it seems natural that the corporate sector, which has regained profitability as a result of restructuring, should take the lead by increasing investment followed by the household sector as income conditions gradually improve. This is the development we are now witnessing.

Second, we observe polarization in various areas of the economy. For example, a moderate recovery of business fixed investment does not mean a uniform increase across the board. While those industries which produce basic materials are burdened with excess capacity and continue to restrain investment, those related to information technology, such as electric machinery, have increased investment substantially. Another example. In the labor market, we have recently witnessed the situation where new job offers have been growing at a double-digit rate on a year-on-year basis while the unemployment rate has remained high or even slightly increased. This signifies a widening mismatching of supply and demand in the labor market. Under the globalization of market economies and the progress of information and telecommunications technology, while workers with skills that firms need are in short supply, workers who have accumulated firm-specific skills under the traditional lifetime employment system are no longer in demand.

When economic recovery and structural adjustment proceed simultaneously, we often observe conflicting developments. Thus, to accurately grasp economic developments, it is extremely important not only to examine macroeconomic indicators but also to thoroughly understand the microeconomic movements behind such macroeconomic indicators.

2. Movements Toward Structural Reform
Response to the aftereffects of the bursting of the bubble - declining financial intermediary function
Now let me turn to the earnest structural reform efforts being seen in various areas of the economy.

First, the problem of the declining financial intermediary function after the bursting of the bubble has begun to be resolved. It goes without saying that the aftereffects of the bursting of the bubble were one of the major factors responsible for making the 1990s a 'lost decade' in Japan. The bursting of the bubble created the balance sheet problem. Indeed, the non-performing asset problem of financial institutions has reduced their risk-taking capacity and impaired the smooth circulation of money. In particular, behind the extremely severe recession from the end of 1997 to 1998 was a decline in confidence on the part of both the corporate sector and the household sector stemming from financial system instability and the deterioration of the financial intermediary function which has often been termed a credit crunch.

Since spring last year when the Bank of Japan effected the zero interest rate policy and public funds were injected into major banks to strengthen their capital base, public confidence in the financial system has been gradually restored, and we are observing a favorable impact on the economy. Furthermore, an important development which has not been observed for nearly half a century since the end of World War II, is that the financial industry is moving toward large-scale consolidation.

Last year, private consumption supported the economy in the midst of a decline in household income, which means a decline in the savings rate. This can perhaps be interpreted as households, which were concerned with financial system instability and increased their savings from the end of 1997 to early 1998, turning to loosen their purse strings. In this regard, the Survey on Lifestyle and Financial Behavior conducted by the Bank of Japan indicates that since spring last year not only has concern over the collapse of financial institutions subsided but also the number of respondents expressing worries about job security and earnings or refraining from spending has also gradually decreased. On the part of the corporate sector, responses to the Bank's Tankan survey indicate that the improvements in the lending attitude of financial institutions and also their funding conditions have been gathering momentum. Moreover, the willingness of small and medium-sized firms to invest, which is mostly financed by bank borrowing, seems to have gradually strengthened, though up until now such investment has been contained within cash flow and has not yet led to an increase in bank borrowing.

Considering that the non-performing asset problem of financial institutions has not been completely resolved, and taking into account the excess debt of the corporate sector, we have not yet reached a point where we can say that the problem of the aftereffects stemming from the bursting of the bubble has been resolved. In addition, the continuous decline in property prices is another matter of concern. Furthermore, the consolidation of financial institutions is not merely a matter of size. The key to successful consolidation is to become more efficiently managed through a strategy of 'selection and concentration,' and it will take more time for such consolidation to bear fruit. Nevertheless, at this moment, it should be noted, and welcomed, that amid the irreversible trend of financial globalization and the advance of information technology it is the initiative of the private sector, not that of the public sector, which will pave the way to the new economy.

Parallel with such moves on the part of major financial institutions, progress has been made in direct financing such as the establishment of MOTHERS on the Tokyo Stock Exchange in November 1999, followed by NASDAQ JAPAN established in early May at the initiative of the private sector and which will start operation in June. I have repeatedly emphasized that at the present time when structural adjustment is much needed, abundant domestic savings should be utilized to finance investment in the form of 'risk capital.' And, I thus welcome that such markets have been inaugurated to fulfill an intermediary function for risk capital.

New phase of corporate restructuring
Second, efforts toward structural reform have also been made in terms of corporate restructuring, and I think we have begun to observe the result of such efforts. When talking about restructuring and the results in the recent period, those in the business world say that they have been pursuing restructuring for a long time. I fully commend past efforts toward corporate restructuring, but what I would like to emphasize here is that the restructuring witnessed since last year is of a different nature compared with the past and such a tendency has recently become more distinct. In my view, past restructuring focused mostly on cost reductions, in other words, downsizing. To the contrary, current restructuring, though initially having a tendency toward downsizing, has shifted to focus on business content or re-engineering, which means the restructuring of production and management systems which have been rendered inefficient. I believe that the restructuring of Japanese firms has truly entered a new phase.

Behind such a change in the focus of restructuring, those in the business world, as in the case of financial institutions, experienced a protracted recession and were faced with a very severe financial environment, particularly from 1997 to 1998. During this period, many small and medium-sized firms faced funding difficulties, and from the summer to the autumn of 1998 when financial and capital markets both at home and abroad were under stress due to such factors as the Russian crisis, not a few representative big Japanese firms also faced similar difficulties. Such an experience linked with changes in the accounting system, namely the consolidated and mark-to-market methods, brought about the recognition or a sense of crisis on the part of firms that Japan's traditional corporate governance including the main bank system and cross-shareholdings would not be viable for long and that for their own survival they should enhance their evaluation in the capital market through such measures as improved capital efficiency. All this seems to have triggered current full-fledged restructuring.

Current restructuring is different from past downsizing in its nature because firms are required more than ever to efficiently allocate resources and improve profitability. For example, since big firms engaged in the production of electric machinery and chemicals could not enjoy economies of scope any more, they concentrated on areas where they had the most edge, recently termed 'areas of core competence' in Japan, and at the same time withdrew from or scaled down unprofitable business areas. And, among basic materials industries burdened with excess capacity, there have been movements toward consolidation including mergers and acquisitions and obsolete equipment beginning to be scrapped. Recent restructuring and consolidation in the corporate sector, including financial institutions, extends beyond the existing keiretsu and corporate group frameworks, and in some cases has proceeded globally with the involvement of foreign capital. Also, good use is being made of such new methods as mergers and acquisitions and the holding company format. Last year, mergers and acquisitions increased substantially and direct investment into Japan, which indicates foreign capital inflows, reached a record high 1.5 trillion yen on a balance of payment statistics basis, three times the prior-year level. Of course, it cannot be denied that the recovery of corporate profitability has been largely attributable to past restructuring, that is, downsizing centering on a reduction in labor costs. However, current restructuring can be expected to exert pressure on firms to withdraw from low profitability areas and concentrate resources on highly profitable and strategic areas such as investment in information technology-related areas. We continue to pay close attention to how the recent development will lead to the recovery of corporate profitability and competitiveness, and eventually the restoration of corporate vitality.

Possibility of an information technology (IT) revolution
Third, the IT revolution seems to have reached Japan. In the 1990s, with the improvement in productivity induced by the expansion of IT-related investment, the United States enjoyed prolonged expansion and price stability, although we observed such distortions as excessive consumption due to higher stock prices and a rising current account deficit. In Japan, we have recently witnessed a rapid increase in IT-related investment by semiconductor manufacturers. And, I feel that expectations are gradually emerging in Japanese business circles that a mega change which occurs only once or twice in a hundred years might have started in Japan. However, there still remains a deeply-embedded pessimism that Japan is more than ten years behind the United States in IT-related business areas and it is not easy even to catch up. To understand the coexistence of expectations and pessimism, let us examine discussions regarding how the IT-related revolution has been affecting Japan's economy.

One topic for discussion is the spread of IT-related investment in the corporate sector. In this regard, it is necessary to distinguish between investment by IT producers and that by IT users. It is true that IT-related investment in the United States has centered on the computer and telecommunications industries which have recorded the largest improvement in productivity. But it is also true that IT users in a wide variety of industries such as other manufacturing, financial, and distribution industries have improved productivity by way of IT-related investment, which has laid the foundation for the prolonged expansion of investment. In contrast, the current surge in IT-related investment in Japan seems to be at the stage where IT producers such as semiconductor-related manufacturers expand their investment in response to the worldwide expansion of IT demand. While they are important investments, the experience in 1995 and 1996 shows us that an investment boom is bound to be cyclical, which sometimes takes the form of large-scale stock adjustment. Therefore, it is important whether investment by IT users is sustainable. It is encouraging news that many firms are considering strengthening their production and sales systems by introducing supply chain management with the aim of information sharing among client firms as well as procuring materials through the Internet. In the Economic Planning Agency's Survey on Corporate Behavior published this April, many surveyed listed firms reported excess production capacity on the one hand, and a shortage of information-related equipment on the other. The future outlook for investment by IT users needs to be judged in relation to Japanese-style management. Here, I would like to point out that the spread of such investment to a wide area, including small and medium-sized firms, will be the key to the sustainable expansion of investment, and eventually to an improvement in productivity.

IT can be utilized by the corporate sector which is called B-to-B, that is, business to business, and also by the household sector which is called B-to-C, that is, business to consumer. Another topic for discussion is how Japanese firms will respond to the situation when IT is introduced to the household sector. The IT revolution in the United States in the 1990s substantially enhanced productivity through the enhancement of operational processes as personal computer networks were introduced to the corporate sector. Japan was behind the US in this regard, which is perhaps one of the reasons behind the 'lost decade of the 1990s.' Some features of Japan's corporate system were said to be related to this delay. As you may remember, up until the 1980s, Japanese-style management, as represented by keiretsu transactions, the main bank system, and lifetime employment, had been regarded as superior in terms of information sharing among related parties through long-term relationships. In contrast, since the US-style big business model was vertically integrated and susceptible to sectionalism, it had been considered inferior to the Japanese system in processing information. However, any management system should be evaluated in relation to the technology available at the time. The Japanese system is no exception and it has been found to be not necessarily superior on all accounts when the cost of transmitting and processing information is dramatically declining due to the rapid progress of information and telecommunications technology. Rather, the merits of the Japanese system led to a lack of incentive to actively introduce IT for cost reduction purposes. In addition, while firms must review existing transaction styles and reduce workers to take full advantage of the benefits of IT, the Japanese system tends to make it difficult for firms to implement such changes. Furthermore, it should be noted that the 1990s was a period during which Japan had to face the aftermath of the bursting of the bubble and also that it has been difficult to create 'venture businesses' in the cultural and social climate of Japan. Considering that all this has constituted constraints for Japanese firms to introduce IT, the IT revolution has widened the gap in competitiveness between the United States and Japan.

The recent move toward full-fledged restructuring and increase in investment by IT users can be seen as evidence that Japanese firms have begun to be aware of various problems related to IT. The foundation for venture businesses to be created and flourish is finally being laid as symbolized by the 'bit valley,' and partly due to such development the number of newly established firms as a whole has been gradually increasing since last summer. The use of IT in the corporate sector has just started in Japan. Even though the corporate sector in Japan lags behind that in the United States in the use of IT, there is a piece of good news for Japan. The next ten years are regarded as a period during which IT will be actively used by consumers, and not only personal computers but also IT-related electrical appliances and mobile phones will be used as IT terminals. Japanese firms have traditionally had a competitive edge in such areas as electrical appliances and mobile phones, and indeed they are the front runner in such areas as the utilization of mobile phones as information terminals. Regarding the business-to-consumer area, the United States is yet to construct a plausible business model, and there is still a lot of uncertainty about the future. Notwithstanding this, it is important that even though the relative position of the United States and Japan may not be reversed, the possibility has emerged that Japan can fully compete with the United States in the IT field. These developments also seem to have had a positive impact on firms in enabling them to regain vitality.

3. Escape from the Lost Decade
Remaining tasks
Compared with my July 1999 speech in which I said that the dynamism of the Japanese economy had been contained, the developments that I have described today indicate that such dynamism has eventually begun to be re-ignited. However, this is far from saying that all structural problems inherent in Japan's economy have been solved.

For example, regarding the balance sheet problem of financial institutions, while the financial system has indeed escaped from instability, the problem is not yet fully resolved as I previously remarked. The excess debt problem on the part of firms has yet to be completely solved. Furthermore, as a result of firms putting more emphasis on capital efficiency, for a while they will continue to reduce assets with low profitability. In this regard, the Bank of Japan's March Tankan survey showed that major manufacturing industries expected the ratio of ordinary profits to sales for the current financial year to be around 4 percent, which is about the past average. We may be able to say that profitability indices on a flow basis have recovered to the average level of the past. However, profitability indices on a stock basis such as ROE and ROA have remained substantially below the level in the 1980s, which is a different aspect of what I referred to as a 'decline in capital productivity' in my speech last summer. Under such circumstances, while investment will be made in highly profitable new areas such as the IT-related field, asset reduction will continue in existing low profit areas in order to raise ROE and ROA. According to the Economic Planning Agency's Survey on Corporate Behavior, about half of listed firms responded that it would take more than two years for their real estate, buildings, and production facilities to return to appropriate levels.

With respect to corporate restructuring and the IT revolution, there is no knowing how they will lead to an improvement in corporate profitability and increase in investment. Even if higher profitability and larger investment were realized, there is a possibility that the polarization seen in the economy might become, albeit temporarily, more apparent. For example, while there are industries regaining profitability supported by restructuring and IT demand, not a few firms will be left behind in traditional and domestic demand-oriented industries. In this regard, public utilities, which have experienced a series of deregulatory measures, continue to suppress investment, and small and medium-sized wholesalers and retailers who are susceptible to the effects of the distribution revolution have been slow to exhibit a business recovery. Regarding employment, there is a possibility that while demand for workers who have skills compatible with the new era increases, demand for workers who lack such skills declines. In this context, the unemployment problem might become an issue. These negatives can be termed the 'shadow of structural reform.'

Since it is difficult to forecast the impact of IT on corporate profitability and growth, we should bear in mind that there may be large swings in the stock market which tends to strongly respond to a variety of forecasts. In fact, strong expectations last year for the growth of IT-related industry led to a substantial increase in the prices of IT-related stocks. On the other hand, while the improvements in Japan's economy is becoming distinct, IT-related stocks in Japan have recently been bearish reflecting the worldwide correction of IT-related stocks. These swings are unavoidable to some extent when the market is trying to identify growth industries and the key firms which lead such industries. The swings in stock prices will reveal promising new technologies and firms which incorporate these technologies, and nurture them. The Bank of Japan continues to pay due attention to stock price developments, and, in so doing, we think it important to calmly identify the meaning and background of stock price fluctuations.

Furthermore, a declining birth rate and aging society present a long-term challenge to Japan's economy. For example, with respect to the high savings rate of the private sector in Japan, I have often remarked that the lack of consensus among the public as to how future pensions and medical fees should be funded has restrained consumption through anxiety about the future. In this regard, the introduction of a nursing care system from this year is certainly a step forward, and I hope this system will take hold.

'Creative destruction' revisited
When the economy recovers, as is now happening, it might well be the case that efforts for structural reform might be neglected due to a sense of security. In addition, when the shadow of structural reform becomes conspicuous, for example in employment, calls to reverse such reform and pressure for additional macroeconomic policy measures such as the expansion of aggregate demand are very likely to intensify. However, there is no doubt that structural reform has contributed to the current economic recovery, and we should not forget that remaining structural problems must be solved to achieve sustained economic expansion in the future. Structural problems cannot be solved solely by macroeconomic policy measures such as monetary and fiscal policy. Now that financial and capital markets are highly globalized, any attempt to wipe out past problems by generating inflation will never be successful. Let me emphasize again that it is private sector vitality in the form of 'creative destruction' that can solve these structural problems. And, as the US experience shows, private sector vitality will gradually absorb the adverse effects of structural reform.

In this 'era of metamorphosis' as represented by the current IT revolution, there exists considerable uncertainty about the future. From another angle, we can say that it is an era where innovation can lead to business opportunities. Under such circumstances, the role which the public sector should play is to prepare a market environment which is conducive to nurturing innovation. One thing is the stability of the macroeconomic environment. In this regard, it is the responsibility of the Bank of Japan to maintain stable macroeconomic conditions through price stability. Other important roles that the public sector should play are to promote deregulation and improve the taxation and legal systems so that firms and households can take appropriate risks more easily and operate more flexibly.

As such, it is my view that the role of the public sector in this era of metamorphosis should be to focus on preparing an appropriate market environment. In this regard, we should learn from the US experience where the early Clinton administration advocated the 'information super highway' plan, but which was later dropped in favor of preparing an environment conducive to encouraging the IT revolution led by the private sector. In Japan, triggered by severe economic conditions in 1997 and 1998, we have seen efforts toward preparing an environment suitable for economic rebirth, including enactment of the Economic Revitalization Law. As we move toward a full-fledged economic recovery, the role of the public sector and economic policy should be flexible so as to be able to remain consistent with an era of metamorphosis. In this regard, it is necessary to examine the role of public investment, the level of which is said to be very high among industrial countries, from the viewpoint of fiscal deficits as well as whether such investment is in line with the current era of metamorphosis.

In July 1999 when I spoke on structural problems in Japan's economy, there were more pessimistic views about Japan's economy than today. On that occasion, I said I was proud of Japan's high quality labor force, technology, and management skills which had created a big economic power from the ruins after the war, and emphasized the need of 'creative destruction.' And now, after almost a year, I am quite encouraged to find that signs of a recovery have been increasing. I hope the current favorable developments will gather momentum and that the day will soon come when Japan's economy returns to a full-fledged recovery path led by the private sector. Let me conclude my remarks by saying I hope that the 1990s will be revaluated as the ten years which laid the foundation for the prosperity of the next generation.",,Positive,0.6033963561,,
"Jun. 7, 2000","The outline of Governor's Speech on June 7, 2000 (The Role of Japan amid the Changing International Financial Environment)","1. Introduction
Thank you for inviting me to the 263rd Executive Board of Directors' Meeting. It is a great pleasure to have this opportunity to address such a distinguished audience. It also brings back memories of my days as one of the Council's Executive Directors and Vice Chairman under Chairman Mimura. Your invitation today allows me to be here again, for the first time in almost ten years since I left the Council to become Chairman of the Japan Association of Corporate Executives. Knowing that many of you come from trading companies which are active globally, today I'd like to share my ideas from the viewpoint of the role of Japan amid the changing international financial environment.

2. Tensions Generated by Globalization
Having previously worked for the Bank of Japan for 34 years, I had a chance to work in the then Foreign Department, our London Office and other positions related to the Bank's international activities. It was a great experience for me to attend important international meetings such as the BIS and the then G5 meetings.

Then, two years ago, I returned to the Bank of Japan as Governor. Now, representing the Bank, I have a chance to again take part in various international meetings. Attending such meetings, I have noticed two things. First, the number of international meetings has multiplied over the years. In this context, of particular note is that the presence of emerging-market countries, particularly the Asian economies, has also increased. One reason for this is somewhat paradoxical in that since the Asian currency crises of 1997, there is a consensus that the economic and financial stability of emerging-market economies is crucial for global economic and financial stability. Indeed, the rise in the number of international meetings and participants evidences the extent to which economies are becoming globalized.

The second thing I have noticed is that various kinds of tensions have arisen as the market economy has become more globalized. I clearly recall NGO activists surrounding the WTO's Ministerial Conference in Seattle last December. The IMFC meeting, which I attended in late April on the day after the G7 Meeting, was also the target of similar protests.

How can it be that the IMF, a pivotal contributor to the development of the liberalized market economy after the Second World War, and the WTO, a legitimate successor to GATT, have become the targets of such protests? Perhaps the phenomenon can be seen as a typical example of increased tension between those who have ridden the tide of the market-oriented economy and those who have grave concerns about global environmental issues and widening gaps among regions which are possibly caused by rapid global developments.

I think many agree that the world economy is currently in the midst of one of its most important turning points since the industrial revolution of the 19th century. Ongoing globalization and computerization are mega trends which will continue well into the future. In this context, competition at the global level is expected to intensify. It is global competition which is the principal driving force behind economic dynamism. No one can stop this trend and we should react positively. However, we cannot deny the fact that newly formed tensions and uncertainties have emerged. Therefore, we should continue to look for ways to promote the sound and stable development of the world economy through steady efforts to establish appropriate rules and regulations that are compatible with the new trends. One thing is certain, such efforts will be accompanied by difficulties, involving some disagreements on the international front, and it is incumbent upon us to try to find solutions.

3. Meaning of IMF Reform
Against the background of such trends, the international monetary and financial system is burdened with further responsibilities. In particular, the Asian currency crises brought to the fore various issues of concern to international financial circles including the prevention and resolution of future currency crises. And, the outcome of discussions constitutes part of the concept of the so-called 'new financial architecture'. The Financial Stability Forum, which was inaugurated last April at the request of the G7, has published recommendations on such issues as highly leveraged financial institutions (for example, hedge funds) and international capital flows. This is one example of the fruit of work undertaken by international financial fora.

The reform of the IMF has been a most important issue. And it was also the Asian currency crises that triggered intense debate about the necessity of such reform. The Asian currency crises that broke out as the result of the rapid outflow of short-term capital are called '21st century-type crises'. Here, the IMF has come to be the target of criticism which holds that IMF should improve its surveillance ability and increase transparency of its policy-making processes because it has not sufficiently carried out its mission of crisis prevention and resolution. I personally think the problems surrounding the IMF are deep-rooted and partly reflect its history.

As you well know, the period preceding the Second World War was characterized by such negative factors as competitive devaluations, restrictions on current account transactions, and the widespread use of protectionist measures. Without doubt, these had a significant impact on the international economy and created tensions between countries, only fueling pro-war sentiment. The IMF was established with the aim of avoiding the repetition of such disruption. The primary concern of the time was to create a well-structured and crisis-proof international monetary system. For example, fixed parity between the US dollar and gold (with $1 equivalent to 35 ounces), the adoption of the adjustable peg system, and abolition of restrictions on current account transactions were key elements underpinning the Bretton-Woods architecture. Regarding capital account transactions, member countries of the IMF were allowed to impose some degree of restrictive measures. Therefore, it is fair to say that more attention was paid to the stable expansion of current account transactions rather than capital account transactions.

However, things have dramatically changed since then. With respect to the foreign exchange regime, the so-called 'Nixon shock' in 1971 marked an abrupt end to convertibility between the US dollar and gold, which eventually led to the arrival of floating exchange regimes on a global scale in 1973. And, capital account liberalization was pursued much more vigorously than most architects of the Bretton-Woods system envisioned. As a result, the volume of today's cross-border capital flows far exceeds current account transactions. As I noted earlier, the huge increase in cross-border capital flows seems to exert a bigger impact than current account transactions on the economic and financial conditions of individual countries, and, at times, could trigger serious currency crises.

In brief, present conditions surrounding the international financial system are entirely different from what they used to be when the IMF was created. Amid accelerating globalization and accompanying rising tensions, what kind of contributions can the IMF make to the stability of the international monetary system? What should be the core functions of the IMF in this context? These questions are prime movers behind recent discussions on IMF reform.

The IMFC meeting I attended this April in Washington was previously called the Interim Committee. But, unlike the Interim Committee, the IMFC is structured as a permanent forum. Thus, the transformation of the Interim Committee into the IMFC comprises part of efforts to strengthen the IMF, and it can be seen as a symbol of the current challenges facing the international financial system. At the first IMFC meeting this April, we had lively discussions on how to reform the IMF. Although further consideration is needed to reach any realistic conclusions, I believe that some kind of consensus was formed regarding the future direction we should take in reforming the IMF.

First, we agreed to develop rules under the basic concept of utilizing market functions. In this regard, the latest G7 and IMFC communiques underscore the importance of involving the private sector in forestalling and resolving currency and financial crises. At the same time, it was agreed to strengthen the IMF's role in making various rules that can be applied to new developments in global markets, and in monitoring the observance of such rules by member countries. Such a role can be considered as ensuring conditions for proper market functioning are in place, or to correct market failures.

Second, we agreed to review or redefine IMF operations under the basic concept of utilizing market functions. In this regard, it was suggested that, for instance, IMF lending operations be limited to short-term liquidity provision to members facing capital account crises. It was also argued that medium and long-term financial support for promoting development be reduced.

Third, since the IMF has been strongly criticized for lack of transparency in its decision-making procedures, its accountability should be enhanced in the interest of better governance.

IMF reform has just started. However, it is an important challenge that may determine the future course of the international monetary and financial system. Japan is the second largest subscriber to the IMF, following the US. At the same time, Japan is one of the countries most involved in international financial markets, as witnessed by the fact that Japan is the world's largest capital exporter as well as largest net creditor. Japan has made various contributions to the formation of a consensus among international financial circles regarding the direction of IMF reform and it should continue to do so.

4. Role of Japan in a Changing International Financial Environment
(1) What is expected of Japan?
Now, let me clarify Japan's role in this period of changing international finance. First, Japan should actively participate in developing international rules. The introduction of international standards and codes involves important elements that determine not only the future path of global economic development but which may also have a substantial impact on domestic finance and the economy. For example, this can be seen in Japan by observing how corporate management is being affected by the introduction of international accounting rules. In practice, however, to take part in international rule making is not as easy as it may sound. It requires an enormous amount of knowledge as well as powers of persuasion. And here we should note Japan's position in the global economy as well as the role it plays in Asian economies. It is thus desirable that Japan be actively involved in and contribute to international rule making efforts with a full understanding of the situation in the region. In this context, the Bank of Japan seeks to strengthen relations with colleagues in EMEAP (Executives' Meeting of East Asia-Pacific Central Banks) through more intensive dialogue regarding the regional economy and finance. Furthermore, Japan is expected to contribute to the process of implementing rules in Asia through technical assistance in the field of financial system reform and the establishment of economic and financial infrastructure such as data collection and dissemination systems.

Japan's second role is to directly contribute to the stable growth of the global economy by securing its own sustainable growth. For this purpose, bringing the economy back to the recovery phase of the business cycle is an important challenge. Furthermore, it is more important that Japan goes beyond this by regaining economic dynamism by steadily pursuing structural reform. In addition, as I will discuss later, it will be a big challenge for Japan to win global confidence in its economy as a whole.

(2) Japan's Economy and the Role of the Yen
I do not have enough time today to discuss Japan's expected role in a comprehensive manner. Therefore, I would like to focus my thoughts on one of the important issues regarding the role of Japan's economy in the global economy and finance; that is 'the role of the yen as an international currency.' This issue is also closely related to the point I have just made: how to win global confidence in Japan's overall economy.

International currency can be defined as 'a currency actively used by non-residents as a tool to measure, to store, and to exchange value.' Although non-residents are using the yen, it is perhaps hard to say that it is 'actively used.' Rather, it is often argued that the yen is not sufficiently used as an international currency relative to Japan's status in the global economy. What does this mean?

For currencies to be widely used in a global manner, there are several conditions to be met. First, it is indispensable to win confidence in the currency internationally. In order to realize this goal, we need a strong economy supported by a stable currency value.

In this connection, let me briefly describe the current state of Japan's economy. It is becoming increasingly clear that the economy is improving with support from decisive macroeconomic policy. In particular, we are observing welcoming signs in private sector demand as evidenced by a continuing gradual increase in capital expenditures against the background of improving corporate profits. In the coming period, we will carefully examine momentum of the recovery, focusing on how such recovery in the corporate sector will spread to the household sector.

Here, I come back to the issue of an international currency. As the second condition for the international use of a currency, I can point out its 'user friendliness'. For a currency to be user friendly, the existence of a liberalized and open economic environment, which includes deep financial and capital markets, is necessary. Third, the existence of a mechanism by which the creation of an international network for a currency is catalyzed and accelerated is significant. For example, the global activities of the shipping, finance, and insurance industries under the British Empire, and then American multinational firms in the finance and IT industries, respectively accelerated global use of the pound and US dollar. It may be possible that Japan's contribution to other countries through more intensive technical assistance will lead to an expanded network for the yen.

In sum, to what extent a nation's currency is globally used depends on confidence in the nation's economy as a whole. To enhance such confidence, every measure should be taken with the three aspects I mentioned in mind.

I would like to take up the issue of the Japanese government bond (JGB) market as an example. The ratio of JGBs owned by non-residents is currently only a few percent, which is extremely low compared to the US and other G10 countries. This is especially understandable when Japan's cumulative current account surplus and high savings rate are taken into consideration. However, in terms of the global bond index, which world bond investors refer to when making investment judgments, the share of JGBs is the second largest next to that of US government bonds. If the current budget situation of the two countries remains unchanged for some time, it is possible that the share of JGBs will become comparable to that of US Treasuries. If so, it is imperative that the JGB market becomes attractive for international investors.

What is necessary for the JGB market to achieve the global standard? Needless to say, policy decisions that might impair confidence in JGBs must be avoided. In this regard, budget policy of the government should be constrained in the long run. It would also be significant to improve the safety and user friendliness of the JGB market from the viewpoint of such aspects as the usability of futures and repo markets, the tax treatment of JGBs, and the standardization of trading and settlement customs.

In my speech today, I have touched upon three conditions for a currency to be internationally used, namely, confidence in the currency, high degree of user friendliness, and an international network. I believe that these conditions coincide with the direction that Japan should move in the coming century. Let me add that every time I refer to the 'internationalization of the yen', it carries my strong hope that Japan will adjust to the new global economic order and contribute to international rule making and the foundation for sustainable economic and financial development in the Asian region.

"Jul. 3, 2000","Opening Speech by the Governor at the Ninth International Conference held by the Institute for Monetary and Economic Studies, Bank of Japan, on July 3, 2000","Good morning, Ladies and Gentlemen.

It is a great pleasure to have an opportunity to meet such distinguished guests from academic circles and various central banks on the occasion of the Ninth International Conference hosted by the Institute for Monetary and Economic Studies. I would like to welcome all of you who have kindly found time out of your busy schedules to participate in this Conference.

The topic of the Conference is 'The Role of Monetary Policy under Low Inflation,' which is the very problem that the Bank of Japan has faced since the 1990s and perhaps what many central banks might face in the future.

The 1990s is often referred to as the 'lost decade' for Japan's economy. During that period, Japan's real GDP growth was next to last among G7 countries and also recorded the largest drop compared with the 1980s. Inflation declined to almost zero, and at times we faced the danger of falling into a deflationary spiral. In response, the Bank of Japan conducted aggressive monetary easing. In particular, since February 1999, the Bank has pursued the unprecedented policy of guiding short-term money market rates down to virtually zero percent to prevent the economy from tumbling into a deflationary spiral and also to support a recovery.

What are the factors behind Japan's lost decade of the 1990s? One basic structural factor is that a variety of systems which had supported the post-war development of Japan's economy became unsustainable. Another factor is the emergence and bursting of the bubble. While the emergence of the bubble led to many much needed structural reforms being postponed, its bursting brought Japan's economy to the verge of falling into a deflationary spiral.

Though the main purpose of this Conference is not to discuss the emergence and bursting of the bubble, when we at the Bank of Japan discuss the role of monetary policy under low inflation, we cannot but refer to the problems we experienced during the bubble period.

In this regard, let me outline some lessons from the bubble period which I find important in an individual study made by Bank staff relating to monetary policy in the late 1980s.

One prominent feature which characterized the bubble period in Japan was the euphoric sentiment which prevailed in every segment of society, and which led to extremely bullish expectations. In this regard, we think it is not sufficient to understand the bubble solely in terms of the rise in asset prices such as property and equity prices. In the study I mentioned, the bubble economy is defined as a combination of the rapid increase in asset prices, the expansion of monetary aggregates, and the overheating of economic activity. And, Japan's economy did indeed experience such developments from 1987 through 1990.

A number of factors were intertwined in the background of such euphoria, and monetary easing was certainly one of them. Monetary easing was a necessary condition for the emergence of the bubble, and to that extent should be held responsible. But, in our defense, I have to say that if we had tried to prevent the emergence and expansion of a bubble by monetary policy alone, we would have had to raise interest rates to levels which could not be justified because of the relatively stable prices at the time. This is one of the difficulties we face in dealing with a bubble.

The next question is: In what respect was monetary policy responsible for the emergence and expansion of the bubble? It is true that we had maintained low interest rates for a relatively long period, even after the summer of 1988 when the economy was clearly on a recovery path, and allowed unfounded expectations to be embedded in the market and society that such low interest rates would continue for a considerable period. We should take it seriously that this was undeniably one of the driving forces behind the expansion of the bubble.

What should be done to avoid repeating such an experience? We hear a variety of suggestions: For example, ""The Bank of Japan should have paid more attention to the movement of money supply or the rise in asset prices,"" and ""It has made a mistake by putting too much emphasis on the foreign exchange rate in the conduct of monetary policy."" Unfortunately, these are reflections and lessons with the benefit of hindsight, and we cannot fully use them as a practical guideline for making policy on a real time basis.

We need a more pragmatic approach. From such a viewpoint, the most significant lesson that we should keep in mind is the importance of evaluating risks to the economy at an early stage, and of dealing with them in a preemptive manner. As I have said, it would not have been possible for monetary policy alone to have prevented the bubble from emerging. However, if we conducted monetary policy in a preemptive manner by taking into account future risks over the long run, economic fluctuation during the bubble period might have been less.

As a matter of fact, it is extremely difficult to identify whether it is a bubble or not when we are actually experiencing bubble expansion. One of the reasons for this difficulty is that we cannot exclude from the observed reality the impact of changes in economic structure. For example, during the bubble period many presented a seemingly plausible argument that a rapid rise in property prices in Tokyo could be justified in view of the increasing role of Tokyo as an international financial center, but which could not be proved to be true at the time.

Inevitably, the central bank always faces two risks. They are similar to statistical errors. One risk is that the Bank might mistakenly tighten monetary policy when the economy is about to benefit from a marked improvement in productivity, and as a result suppress the growth potential of the economy. The other risk is that it allows the bubble to expand by wrongly interpreting the supposed improvement in productivity as real. When we make a policy decision, we should evaluate not only which one of these two risks has the greater probability of emerging, but also the socioeconomic cost of each. Our experience of the bubble period seems to indicate that we did not fully recognize that the risk of wrongly interpreting a supposed productivity improvement could deliver such a serious blow to the sound development of the economy over the long run.

What should have been done to calm the euphoric sentiment at that time and turn the focus of society to the potential risk facing the economy from a more long-term perspective? The important lesson from such a viewpoint is that we need to clearly state the objective of monetary policy, in other words, we need to substantiate the abstract concept of price stability.

Looking back at Japan's economy during the bubble period, CPI inflation had been stable until 1987, began to gradually rise in 1988, and recorded a year-on-year increase of about 1 percent in March 1989, which was immediately before the introduction of the consumption tax. Adjusted for the impact of the consumption tax, it continued to rise after April 1989, reached the 2 percent level in April and the 3 percent level in November 1990, and remained at that level until August 1991.

Since such a price hike considerably lagged the rise in asset prices and could not be regarded as particularly high compared with the figure before the bubble period, the threat of inflation did not constitute a valid argument in convincing the public that monetary conditions needed to be tightened. While inflation during the bubble period was relatively mild, Japan's economy had been brought to the verge of falling into a deflationary spiral in the 1990s. The deflation we observed at that time was largely the result of the bubble economy emerged in the late 1980s.

Such an experience suggests that we as the central bank should aim at price stability which supports medium to long-term sustainable growth, not price stability at a particular point in time. In this context, even if measured inflation is stable, we need to promptly alter interest rates once we judge that the risk of damaging sustainable price stability has become higher. According to this criterion, we have not, to our regret, sufficiently succeeded in maintaining price stability in Japan since the bubble period.

So far, I have mainly described the lessons for monetary policy derived from our experience during the period when the bubble emerged. Of course, we also need to learn from the experience after the bursting of the bubble. It may be too early to summarize the experience and draw lessons, but I am sure we will learn quite a lot from the discussion at this Conference.

It is true that there is yet another major factor behind worldwide disinflation. It is the revolutionary progress of information technology, which we may perhaps call a new industrial revolution, and the resulting improvement of productivity. To find answers to what is price stability and an appropriate monetary policy in the face of rapid disinflation due to higher productivity, are difficult but positive challenges.

In conclusion, I sincerely hope that through fruitful discussion at the Conference, both those from academic circles and central banks will learn more, share the fruit, and make use of the wisdom obtained for the future conduct of monetary policy.

"Jul. 14, 2000","Remarks by Masaru Hayami, Governor of the Bank of Japan, at the Fiftieth Anniversary Symposium of the Institute for Financial Affairs in Tokyo on July 14, 2000. (Financial System Stability and Future Agenda -- Need to Strengthen the Capital Base --)","I am pleased to be invited to this Symposium celebrating the fiftieth anniversary of the Institute for Financial Affairs.

Before I begin, allow me to explain one rule regarding monetary policy meetings under the new Bank of Japan Law, which became effective in April 1998. The rule dictates that the Governor, Deputy Governors, and Members of the Policy Board should not, in principle, make remarks about monetary policy and operations immediately before or after monetary policy meetings. This is intended to avoid any unnecessary speculation or confusion which might be generated by such remarks. We call this the 'blackout rule.' Since there is a monetary policy meeting next Monday, today happens to fall into the period when this blackout rule applies. Therefore, I will not talk about any matters relating to monetary policy, and will refrain from answering any questions on the subject. I would appreciate your kind understanding on this.

Since I began my career as a central banker, a long time ago, I have received a lot of intellectual stimulus from reading the publications of the Institute as well as participating in the study groups and conferences organized by it. And I would like to take this opportunity to thank the Institute for publishing the book on the balance of payments which my colleagues in the then Foreign Department wrote and I edited some 20 years ago in 1977.

On the occasion of the Institute's fiftieth anniversary, when we look back at the past 50 years of Japan's economy, we really have experienced a diversity of situations. Around the time of the Korean War, I was in Osaka and witnessed the reconstruction of the textile industry and the economic boom supported by the special procurements occasioned by that war. Other events in the past 50 years include the reconstruction period following the chaos just after World War Two, the high growth period, the oil shocks, the Plaza Agreement and the appreciation of the yen, the emergence and bursting of the bubble, and the current prolonged recession.

When talking about Japan's economy, some call the past ten years the 'lost decade,' and during this period average annual growth was a meager 1 percent. Against this background, financial institutions have been gradually changing their management strategy while bearing the heavy burden of the past legacy.

Though Japan's financial system has faced an extremely difficult situation for the past several years, it appears that overall stability has finally been restored thanks to various measures. For example, in overseas markets, the difficulty that Japanese banks faced in raising funds around the beginning of last year and the Japan premium, which was the extra cost that they had to pay, have largely subsided against such background as the injection of public funds into major banks in March 1999. At international meetings like the G10 central bank governors meeting at the BIS, which in fact I attended a few days ago, we have seldom heard any concern or criticism about financial system stability in Japan. In Addition, the ratings of Japanese banks, mainly those that have announced merger and consolidation plans, have begun to be upgraded.

And yet, it is true that there exist a number of agendas that we have to tackle to further strengthen financial stability, as evidenced by the recent collapse of Sogo Department Store. Today, I would like to talk about the need to strengthen the capital base, one of the most important agendas over the medium to long term.

Among many issues regarding the capital base, the first is the capital structure of Japanese banks. The risk-based capital adequacy ratio of internationally active Japanese banks was 11.8 percent at the end of March 2000, out of which Tier 1 capital was 6.6 percent. In the case of U.S. money center banks, the capital adequacy ratio was 13 percent, and Tier 1 capital 8 to 9 percent. It should be noted that in the United States, there has been no injection of public funds and deferred tax assets corresponding only to income for the following year are included in Tier 1 capital. If we calculate the Tier 1 capital of internationally active Japanese banks according to the U.S. standard, it would decline from 6.6 percent to the 4 percent level. Indeed, there is clearly a big difference in the capital structure between major Japanese banks and U.S. money center banks. In other words, there exists a difference, significantly larger than what is observed, between Japan and the United States in terms of the strength of banks' capital position.

Under such circumstances, Japanese banks need to strengthen capital base by increasing its key element. Furthermore, from the viewpoint of achieving multiple targets including not only the strengthening of capital base but also a reduction in capital cost and an increase in return on equity, banks should work toward the redemption of high-cost capital and an increase in internal reserves through higher profits.

The second issue is how to measure various risks such as credit, market, and operational risk by an advanced method and to align capital charges closely with these underlying risks. The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision chaired by Mr. William McDonough, President of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, is undertaking reform of the 1988 Basel Capital Accord. In June 1999, a consultative paper proposing a new capital framework was released and public comment was sought until March 2000. Currently, the Capital Accord is being reformed by incorporating the comments received from the public, with the reforms being put into effect two years from now.

The following points deserve particular attention. First, the new Capital Accord will incorporate market and operational risks, which are not taken into account in the current Capital Accord, in banking accounts. Second, it will measure credit risk more precisely and impose capital charges more appropriately.

For the past few years, banks have increasingly faced more complex and sophisticated types of risks. To satisfactorily deal with these risks as well as to win amid the severe competition that is to come, it is necessary that risks should be measured in an accurate way and appropriate capital charges set accordingly.

The third issue for financial system stability in Japan is how to deal with intensified competition triggered by the entry of foreign capital and non-financial firms into the banking industry.

One of the major topics in the financial community in recent years is that foreign capital and domestic non-financial firms, which have detected business opportunities in Japan's banking industry, have become active in purchasing failed banks and establishing Internet banks. Some of these banks have announced their intention to focus on lending to small and medium-sized firms, which had been profitable.

There are also active moves to establish new types of banks which did not exist traditionally. One firm is considering providing payment services by installing automated teller machines in a myriad of convenience stores. Another one is aiming at offering various banking services efficiently through the Internet to satisfy the diverse needs of customers.

The management environment surrounding banks has significantly changed. Competition has further intensified. Under such circumstances, the recent strategy of many banks, whether establishing holding companies, forming a megabank by merger, or focusing on local communities, has emphasized consumer banking and customer targeting, focusing, for example, on small and medium-sized firms.

In consumer banking and customer targeting, competition is already intense among Japanese banks of all sizes, foreign banks, and non-financial firms. To win the race, it is essential to have a detailed database regarding individuals and firms as well as to maintain a large network to reduce operational costs. For this, we need to take full advantage of the progress of information technology, which requires enormous investment. In this regard, whether or not one has sufficient capital to be able to finance such investment is the key to success.

Banks that plan mega-mergers emphasize business areas such as investment banking, project finance, global cash management, and networking in Asia as their primary strategies. In these business areas, major banks in the United States and Europe have already constructed a fairly solid business foundation. Particularly in such business areas as global cash management and global custody, Japanese banks need huge investment and technology to compete with banks in the United States and Europe. The key to success in these business areas is investment in information technology and sufficient capital.

As I just described, strengthening the capital base and pursuing the efficient use of capital seems a typical case of 'easier said than done.' Nevertheless, when we look back at the recovery of U.S. banks from the banking crisis in the early 1990s, we observe the following virtuous circle. First, banks' profitability improved thanks to restructuring. Then, their ratings were upgraded, which led to a reduction in capital cost and fund-raising costs. Such cost reductions contributed to higher profitability. Using increased profits, banks amortized high-cost capital by, for example, purchasing back preferred stock. Higher profits increased internal reserves, return on equity rose, and ratings were further upgraded. These processes continued.

Efficient use of capital means that we need to select targeted business areas and concentrate resources on these selected areas. This reminds me of the fact that Mr. John Reed, Chairman of Citicorp, decided to abolish its investment banking section. In the mid-1990s, return on equity in the investment banking section was as high as 13 percent. Nevertheless, Citicorp pursued its chosen strategy by abolishing the investment banking section and transferring all human and physical resources in it to the consumer banking section. There were various criticisms about Citicorp's decision, but it turned out to be successful. This episode shows that it is ultimately the decision of top management to achieve the strengthening of capital base and efficient use of capital.

There are five months remaining before we enter the twenty-first century. We strongly hope that in the coming century Japanese financial institutions will be internationally competitive and provide the best financial services on a global basis thanks to the efforts of all those concerned in the management of financial institutions.

We at the Bank of Japan will continue to make utmost efforts to maintain financial system stability by utilizing the experience and the lessons learned in the past 50 years, and to preserve independence and transparency, two fundamental concepts underpinning the new Bank of Japan Law.",,Positive,0.8683280349,,
"Aug. 4, 2000","Remarks by Yutaka Yamaguchi, Deputy Governor of the Bank of Japan, at the Japan National Press Club on August 4, 2000 (Thinking behind Current Monetary Policy)","I am honored to be invited today to the Japan National Press Club. I once heard a joke that a central banker can deliver a speech to members of this esteemed Club, who are well known for their barrage of sharp questions, only when the economy is performing satisfactorily and he is confident enough to answer any questions. I am here today, not because this is the case, but because I think it is a good opportunity to elaborate on our thinking behind current monetary policy and ask for your comments. The main purpose of my remarks today is to present an overview of the zero interest rate policy by reviewing various discussions at past monetary policy meetings with respect to the termination of the zero interest rate policy.

I. Economic Developments after the Zero Interest Rate Policy was Adopted
Let me begin by briefly explaining what the zero interest rate policy is. It was in February 1999 that the Bank of Japan effected the zero interest rate policy. At the time, Japan's economy was on the verge of falling into a deflationary spiral which was a vicious circle combining price declines and economic recession. In response, the Bank of Japan decided to guide the short-term interest rate, specifically the uncollateralized overnight call rate, down to virtually zero by flexibly providing ample funds to the money market. Then, in April 1999, the Bank decided to continue the zero interest rate policy until such time it could be ascertained deflationary concern had been dispelled. Chart 1 shows the development of market interest rates since April 1999. To the best of my knowledge, I cannot think of any precedents in financial history, either at home or abroad, where a central bank has guided short-term interest rates down to virtually zero and maintained that level for a long period. Short-term interest rates are the key variable in the transmission mechanism of monetary policy and a central bank influences them by controlling reserves in the money market, thereby affecting various aspects of the overall economy. Thus, guiding short-term interest rates down to virtually zero means that the central bank has used its traditional policy tool to the maximum extent possible.

A variety of economic indicators suggest that Japan's economy is on a recovery path, albeit moderate. Chart 2 compares recent economic conditions with those in February 1999. For example, the year-on-year growth rate of real GDP increased from minus 0.4 percent in the first quarter of 1999 to plus 0.7 percent in the same quarter of 2000, and industrial production growth rose from minus 3.8 percent in the first quarter of 1999 to plus 7 percent in the second quarter of 2000. Business sentiment in terms of the Tankan diffusion index for all industries and sizes of firms has substantially improved from minus 44 in March 1999 to minus 18 in June 2000. And, the consensus forecast of the private sector for real GDP growth for this fiscal year has been revised upward from 0.8 percent at the beginning of this year to 1.5 percent recently. Moreover, June's Tankan survey showed that corporate profits were expected to mark a double-digit increase for two consecutive years in fiscal 1999 and 2000. While inflation in terms of WPI is slightly above the previous year's level, that in terms of CPI is slightly below.

There are a number of factors responsible for the moderate economic recovery. First and foremost is the implementation of several important policy measures to restore financial system stability. Public funds were injected into major banks to strengthen their capital base and a legal framework was established to speed up the bankruptcy process. Under such circumstances, financial institutions themselves are striving to reconstruct their management. The second factor is support from macroeconomic policy, which includes both fiscal policy of the government and the zero interest rate policy of the Bank of Japan. The third factor is the upturn of overseas economies. In addition to the expansion in the United States and Europe, Asian economies have been recovering rapidly after overcoming currency and financial crises. The fourth factor is the boom in the high-tech and IT-related business areas. Whether trends like the IT revolution witnessed in the United States will spread to Japan depends on how firms and individuals as users take advantage of information technology. Japanese producers related to high-tech business have swiftly responded to the rapid increase in demand both at home and abroad, and an increasing number of them have been expanding investment reflecting the tightening supply and demand conditions.

It is natural that economic recovery leads to the question of whether the zero interest rate policy should be terminated. As I mentioned, the Bank of Japan announced in April 1999 that it would continue the zero interest rate policy until deflationary concern had been dispelled. Discussions at subsequent monetary policy meetings have disclosed that such deflationary concern would be dispelled if we became confident that economic recovery was led by private demand. As has been described in the minutes of these meetings, members of the Policy Board have closely examined economic and financial conditions to determine whether deflationary concern has been dispelled. Though the minutes of the July 17 meeting are yet to be released, the statement issued immediately after the meeting in Chart 3 said that the majority of the Policy Board considered that Japan's economy was approaching a stage where deflationary concern might be dispelled. However, it also said that some views were expressed that before reaching a final decision to lift the zero interest rate policy, it was desirable to ensure the firmness of economic conditions including employment and household income. Moreover, it was pointed out that the Board needed to ascertain how the so-called Sogo problem would affect market sentiment.

II. Points at Issue Relating to the Termination of the Zero Interest Rate Policy
As you know, there are arguments for and against the termination of the zero interest rate policy as evidenced in newspaper editorials of recent months as well as the opinions of business leaders, economists, and market participants. Such a division of opinions is usually the case every time the question of raising interest rates is brought up after a period of prolonged monetary easing. In May 1989 when interest rates were last raised in the midst of the bubble economy, very few articles in newspapers and magazines had supported it before the raise. Needless to say, at past monetary policy meetings, we have carefully examined various points related to the pros and cons of lifting the zero interest rate policy. Let me now discuss some of the important points at issue.

Is private consumption recovering?
The first point is whether or not we can conclude that the economy as a whole has fully recovered while a recovery of private consumption has yet to be confirmed. Indeed, the current economic recovery has been driven mainly by an improvement in the corporate sector. While June's Tankan survey shows that the ratio of current profits to sales in the manufacturing industry for fiscal 2000 is expected to recover to 4.01 percent, which is slightly higher than the average of 3.84 percent since fiscal 1980, the recovery of the household sector has been delayed. The underlying trend of private consumption is determined by consumer sentiment and employee income. While consumer sentiment has been improving against such a background as receding concerns over financial system stability and stock prices, employee income has only very recently stopped declining. Thus, we cannot yet confirm a recovery of private consumption as a whole.

Nevertheless, if we look more broadly at the situation Japan's economy faces including such big challenges as the balance sheet adjustment of the corporate sector and the transformation of industrial structure, in the current recovery process we consider it quite logical that an improvement in the corporate sector precedes that in the household sector. In Chart 4, labor's share of income has shown a significant increase, which on the other hand means a substantial decrease in return on capital since the bursting of the bubble. Needless to say, capital is an important factor of production supporting economic development. If capital cannot generate sufficient returns for a long period, it will become difficult for firms to raise capital. In such a case, firms cannot help but improve return on capital by reducing various costs including labor. The need to improve return on capital has become especially pressing for firms directly exposed to pressure from the global financial market. In other words, restructuring of the corporate sector is a prerequisite for sustainable growth of the overall economy including the household sector.

In view of the need to improve return on capital, it is unlikely that household income and private consumption will significantly increase for the time being. Of course, if labor's share of income declines substantially, the resultant stagnation of private consumption will hamper the recovery of the overall economy. Therefore, a delicate balancing of income distribution is the key to a full-fledged economic recovery. In this regard, though the number of employees is still below that of a year ago, supply and demand conditions in the labor market have somewhat tightened as evidenced by the increase in job offers. Wages, which had been decreasing for the past two to three years, have this year increased on a year-on-year basis.

We sometimes discuss the relation between corporate profits and household income metaphorically likening it to the relation between the water level in a dam and the release of water from it. If we can clearly observe the rise in the water level, which signifies increasing corporate profits, the probability that water will be released from the dam rises, leading to an increase in household income and then an increase in private consumption. However, since it is not easy and takes time for firms to raise return on capital and improve their balance sheets, the release of water from the dam cannot increase significantly. Yet I think that if household income recovers even moderately, there is a higher probability that the economy will return to a growth path led by business fixed investment. If I may interpret the thinking of members of the Policy Board behind the statement of July 17, the majority would like to confirm with more confidence that such a mechanism is at work.

Are prices declining?
The second point is whether or not it can be maintained that deflationary concerns have been truly dispelled when CPI and the GDP deflator are still falling. As Chart 5 shows, these price indexes are declining while WPI has recently begun to exceed the prior-year level. Such movements in CPI and the GDP deflator may provoke an argument that not only has deflationary concern not been dispelled, but that the economy is actually in a deflationary state. The reason we are afraid of deflation is because once the economy falls into a deflationary spiral, which is a vicious circle where price declines depress economic activity in turn leading to downward pressure on prices, it is very difficult to escape from it. To avoid such a situation, in February 1999 the Bank adopted the zero interest rate policy, which was a drastic monetary easing measure. All this shows that how to interpret the decline in CPI and the GDP deflator is an important issue and we have been carefully examining it.

A close look at the movement of price statistics may not always lead to a full understanding of what price changes indicate. This is because various price indexes often move in different directions or temporarily their movement does not appear consistent with the movement of other economic indicators. For example, take the latter half of 1988, which is the peak of the bubble period. While the economy was strong, measured prices were extremely stable. Another example is 1991, immediately after the bursting of the bubble. Notwithstanding the fact that the economy entered a serious recession, inflation marked a peak. Furthermore, in 1996 while the GDP deflator traced its largest decline of the 1990s, GDP growth recorded its highest figure in the post-bubble period. These examples underscore the importance of assessing the movement of price indexes in relation to the overall economic situation. The current decline in CPI is partly attributable to such structural changes as those in the distribution system in addition to the past appreciation of the yen and the falling prices of consumer durables. It is also due to the decrease in unit labor cost, which is often observed in the early stage of economic recovery. In the early stage of recovery, productivity rises as idle resources are brought back into use, unit labor cost declines, and then downward pressure on prices is seen. The phenomenon of the decline in labor costs and prices coupled with higher growth was observed in 1987 and 1996. It appears that the factors behind this phenomenon have been partly responsible for the recent decline in prices, particularly in the GDP deflator.

On the other hand, it may be possible to argue that any price declines would eventually lead to the danger of the economy falling into a deflationary spiral. However, if the recent decline in CPI had entailed danger of a deflationary spiral, corporate profits would have declined leading to a decrease in business fixed investment and employment, whereas, in fact, we have observed increases in both corporate profits and business fixed investment. Moreover, such a danger would have adversely influenced the labor market through the supply and demand of goods and services, but, as a matter of fact, wages have stopped declining. To sum up, I do not think it appropriate to judge whether or not the economy might fall into a deflationary spiral simply by looking at the decline in CPI and the GDP deflator alone.

Based on such argument, the Policy Board has closely monitored and examined the deterioration in the supply and demand balance, and the risk of price declines stemming from weak demand. Conceptually, the supply and demand balance in Japan's economy as a whole could be described by such indicators as the output gap. The problem is that it is difficult to accurately estimate the output gap. The difficulty is common to many industrial countries, and the main reason is that the speed of technological innovation has become so fast that it is not easy to measure the economic value of capital. As a result, we face a situation where the estimated output gap cannot explain the fluctuation in prices. For example, in 1998 and 1999, calculations based on traditional models produced large output gap estimates, and not a few economists thus forecast considerable price declines. The actual price decline, however, was not so large as the forecast. On the other hand, the supply and demand balance perceived by firms reported in the Tankan survey has greatly improved during the past year. These observations suggest that in order to grasp the change in the supply and demand balance, we should not only apply the estimated output gap deduced from conventional methodology but also make full use of the information regarding the supply and demand balance for individual goods and services.

Let me summarize my view. First, it is very difficult to accurately estimate the output gap, which is the degree of excess supply in macroeconomic terms. Second, it is likely that the potential growth rate has recently declined substantially as a result of stagnant investment over the past ten years. Thus, even if aggregate demand only grows moderately for one to two years, the supply and demand balance should improve, which is indeed evidenced by economic developments since last year. Third, whether the output gap continues to narrow depends on prospects for economic recovery led by private demand. If we become confident of such a recovery, moderate declines in some price indexes should not necessarily be interpreted as a supply and demand imbalance or manifestation of the risk of a deflationary spiral.

Excessive corporate debt and the financial system problem
The third point is whether or not the economy will exhibit a robust recovery in a situation where firms are burdened with excessive debt and banks still hold a large amount of non-performing assets. Indeed, one of the major factors behind the sluggishness of Japan's economy during the 1990s was balance sheet adjustment at firms and banks. We fully recognize the gravity of the excessive debt held by firms, especially those in the construction, real estate, and distribution industries, not to mention the non-performing assets held by banks. In fact, we experienced a serious financial system crisis in 1997 and 1998 characterized by a large-scale credit crunch and the financial sector exerting strong downward pressure on economic activity. Thus, it is extremely important to incorporate the assessment of financial system into economic outlooks. This is one reason we believe that the economic recovery is more likely to be moderate rather than robust.

It is also true that financial system stability has been significantly restored as a result of the injection of capital into major banks in March 1999. With improved creditworthiness and receding concern over liquidity, banks are once again competing to win good customers. According to the Tankan survey, firms have reported a gradual relaxation in the lending attitude of banks. While we may be far from a situation where many banks aggressively assume credit risk with appropriate risk control systems in place and strongly support economic growth, we are not in a situation where the lending attitude of banks is so cautious that it would hamper economic recovery. Therefore, while there remain industries and firms burdened with excessive debt, I think it possible to expect a recovery, though not as speedy as in previous recoveries, of the overall economy as momentum for new growth intensifies reflecting the progress of technological innovation.

Another reason we care about the debt problem is that when large firms like Sogo collapse, the market sometimes becomes extremely nervous. It should be noted that the impact of a shock differs from case to case. For example, the case of Sogo is special in that its reconstruction framework was suddenly changed. In any event, if there are no problems in the financial system, the collapse of an individual firm is likely to be perceived as an isolated case. At the moment, we need to closely monitor whether there is the risk that the market may suddenly turn nervous, and this is, in my view, one of the factors that should be rightly taken into account in the conduct of monetary policy.

The relationship between structural adjustment and monetary policy
Since the release of the statement on July 17, there have been various comments to the effect that the Bank of Japan should continue the zero interest rate policy until concern of large-scale bankruptcies disappears and structural adjustment is completed. There have also been comments to the contrary, namely, that the continuation of the zero interest rate policy is delaying the progress of structural adjustment. This brings me to my fourth point relating to the termination of the zero interest rate policy, the relationship between it and structural adjustment.

Regarding the view that the Bank should continue the zero interest rate policy until structural adjustment is completed, we do not think this necessary. In discussing this, we need to distinguish between the potential growth rate and the cyclical and short-term growth rate of Japan's economy. In recent years, it is often said that the potential growth rate of the U.S. economy has been boosted by the IT revolution. But it should be pointed out that it took a long time before IT was applied to business and resulted in improved productivity. Similarly, it will take a long time before structural reform promoted by Japanese firms leads to improved productivity and higher potential growth. Here, it should be noted that various forces other than structural adjustment influence the economy. And hence, even if the potential growth rate is low, the economy will be able to grow strongly with the cyclical growth rate exceeding the potential growth rate. This, I think, is the business cycle.

To deal with the decline in potential growth stemming from structural factors, a policy targeted to solve structural problems and firms' own efforts for restructuring are indispensable. There is no other way. In short, monetary policy cannot replace structural policy.

Let me now turn to the contrary comments that the zero interest rate policy has been holding back structural adjustment. We also hear related comments that the zero interest rate policy has been generating various kinds of moral hazard, both socially and economically. It is true that the zero interest rate policy, which provides the market with ample funds to guide the overnight rate to virtually zero, could create a situation where banks and firms have become less sensitive to borrowing costs and liquidity risks. Indeed, it is through this effect that the policy supports economic recovery and promotes structural reform. At the same time, it cannot be denied that the policy may tend to delay structural reform by making economic agents with a large amount of debt less conscious of borrowing costs and liquidity risks. Of course, I do not think it appropriate to lift the zero interest rate policy to prevent moral hazard. Let me make it clear that the termination of the zero interest rate policy depends on whether we can be confident that the economic recovery is being primarily led by private demand.

Is the termination of the zero interest rate policy consistent with fiscal policy?
The fifth point is the relation between the termination of the zero interest rate policy and the government's fiscal policy stance. Some argue that a stimulus from the monetary policy side is essential and it is premature to terminate the zero interest rate policy because no further stimulus from fiscal policy can be expected considering the significant deterioration in the government's fiscal position. Others argue that, when the government formulates a supplementary budget to stimulate the economy, fiscal policy aimed at achieving an economic recovery led by private demand and the Bank's monetary policy should be harmonized.

Of course, the Bank of Japan never ignores the government's fiscal policy stance when conducting monetary policy. As I have reiterated many times, we will not terminate the zero interest rate policy unless we feel confident that the economic recovery is led by private demand. Chart 6 shows the contribution of private demand and government expenditure to the year-on-year growth of real GDP, which indicates that the driving force behind the economy has steadily shifted from government expenditure to private demand, and the GDP growth rate has been gradually rising. The Bank of Japan will terminate the zero interest rate policy only when it feels confident that an economic recovery led by private demand is in prospect, and I believe this is consistent with what the government is aiming at.

Impairing the proper functioning of the market mechanism
The sixth point relates to the functioning of the market mechanism. There is a view that the proper functioning of the financial market has been impaired by the zero interest rate policy and that it should be restored by terminating the policy. In fact, we too were worried about the impairment of market functions when adopting the unprecedented zero interest rate policy in February 1999. Therefore, we took a cautious approach in guiding the overnight call rate to zero by confirming the proper functioning of the market mechanism on the way. In retrospect, it is my tentative assessment at this point in time that the impairment of market functions turned out to be smaller than anticipated. The overnight call rate is not exactly zero percent, though as close to zero as can be, and long-term interest rates are above zero. Under such a configuration of interest rates, the market mechanism is functioning.

The contraction of the call market is often cited as an example to evidence impairment of the market mechanism. This reflects the fact that, as the interest rate on ordinary deposits has been higher than the call rate, investors have transferred funds from the call market to ordinary deposits. Under such circumstances, a sudden withdrawal of funds by investors from ordinary deposits would cause instability in the liquidity position of banks which have received these deposits, and might eventually influence the formation of the overnight call rate. However, this problem cannot be a decisive factor in determining whether to terminate the zero interest rate policy.

Interest income of pensioners
The seventh and last point is the fact that the zero interest rate policy is having a negative effect on economic agents who largely depend on interest income, such as pensioners. Obviously interest income from financial assets has fallen significantly under the zero interest rate policy, and we are well aware of the fact that the policy is adversely affecting households that depend heavily on interest income. The elderly hold a relatively large amount of financial assets as evidenced by the fact that about half of the total financial assets of individuals is held by those aged 60 and over, and whose earned income is not much. As a result, the elderly are most affected as low interest rates have continued for a long period, and we sympathize with their situation.

However, let me emphasize that raising interest rates would not solve the problem. Households can earn interest income from their deposits because banks obtain interest income on their loans. In other words, the source of interest income received is economic growth, and interest income will not be generated if the economy does not grow. Viewed from a different angle, economic growth and increased employment opportunities would ensure the stability of household income. Household income primarily consists of employee income, which accounts for more than 70 percent of national income. By reviewing these facts, I hope you will understand the imminent need to achieve a sustainable economic recovery led by private demand.

III. Monetary Policy under Uncertainty
So far I have presented the majority view of the Policy Board on issues related to the termination of the zero interest rate policy. The Bank of Japan has recently stated that Japan's economy is coming to a stage where the condition for lifting the zero interest rate policy is being met. However, since there are no inflationary risks, some argue that termination of the zero interest rate policy is unnecessary, besides which the risks involved in termination are unknown. We have been discussing the conduct of monetary policy, always bearing in mind the risks of both termination and continuation of the zero interest rate policy. The difficulty inherent in the conduct of monetary policy stems from the fact that a clear decision, whether or not to change interest rates, has to be made under uncertainty with inherently limited information on the outlook and the mechanism of the economy.

Among various metaphors about the central bank, I remember one that says a central bank is like a driver on a winding road with a misted up windshield and rearview mirrors and an inaccurate speedometer. I think this well describes the essence of some of the difficulties that central banks face in conducting monetary policy. The economic outlook corresponds to the misted up windshield, and the limitation of economic statistics to the rearview mirrors and inaccurate speedometer. And the various risks that the economy faces correspond to the winding road. A central bank driving a car under such conditions has to stay alert to anticipated risks while making use of the lessons obtained from past experiences. With this comment as an introduction, let me present my personal view on the meaning of discussing the termination of the zero interest rate policy at a time when we do not observe any imminent risk of inflation.

We often hear the argument that monetary policy should be changed only when the risk of inflation becomes evident. At first glance this argument appears reasonable since the target for monetary policy is price stability. As a matter of fact, in the bubble period of the late 1980s, the conduct of monetary policy was based on this argument. From 1986 through 1988, the economy grew at an annual rate of 5 percent, asset prices soared, and the general price level was extremely stable. Under such circumstances, the Bank of Japan could not find an opportunity to preemptively correct the low interest rate policy at the time. It was only in May 1989 when inflationary pressure became obvious to everybody that the Bank could raise the official discount rate. Since history never exactly repeats itself, we cannot claim that we have fully experienced all the various situations when monetary policy might be changed once inflationary pressure becomes evident. It should also be pointed out that today's situation, which is heavily burdened with the aftermath of the bursting of the bubble, is vastly different from the situation during the bubble period. With these caveats, we should ask ourselves what are the lessons learned from the experience of the late 1980s in today's context? Let me mention two points.

First, the policy change in response to a clear and present risk of inflation would inevitably be monetary tightening, and, moreover, cumulative interest rate hikes would probably be needed as was the case in 1989 and 1990. In view of the very high amount of government bonds outstanding, for example compared with the late 1980s, the capital loss on these government bonds caused by higher interest rates would, other things being equal, pose much larger problems for the economy. We must thus avoid, to the extent possible, monetary policy that forces the central bank to raise interest rates rapidly and substantially at a later stage because it could destabilize the economy and the financial system.

Second, if the zero interest rate policy continues for a long period even after the economy clearly recovers, more economic agents will tend to conduct activities based on the expectation that current extremely low interest rates will be sustained indefinitely. This is what happened in the bubble period, leading to an enormous waste of resources which continues to inflict pain on us today. I do not at all advocate a higher probability that a similar situation would occur on a similar scale. What I would like to mention is that the current situation of financial markets, where, for example, the premium on credit risk is suppressed by the liquidity effect of the zero interest rate policy, could include the potential risk of creating the misallocation of resources.

Then, when is appropriate timing for adjusting interest rates before inflation risk becomes a matter of concern? If we can come up with an perfectly accurate economic outlook as well as the time needed for the policy effect to permeate the economy, we should conduct farsighted and preemptive policy at the right time on an appropriate scale. This is always an ideal vision for central banks. In fact, the Bank of Japan has been making efforts to accurately analyze the past, present, and future economy. Though we make policy judgments based on these analyses, admittedly we conduct monetary policy under great uncertainty with limited second sight as well as imperfect data and information just like the metaphor of the car driver. This is a brutal fact that central banks all over the world, including the Bank of Japan, must face.

There are central banks that visibly incorporate this uncertainty into the modus operandi of the conduct of monetary policy. For example, the Bank of England forecasts inflation, not by a single figure, but by a probability distribution. We can thus easily understand how great uncertainty is in predicting, for example, the growth rate and inflation for 2002. If we have to humbly accept such uncertainty even after we try our utmost to make accurate economic forecasts, one useful approach might be to confirm the degree of economic improvement and adjust monetary easing accordingly in order to realize sustainable growth. As a digression, the Taylor Rule, the most well known of policy rule theories, attracts attention internationally and is actively studied. This Rule advocates the smooth adjustment of interest rates while paying attention to the output gap and fluctuation in prices, which seems to be based on a similar policy philosophy to what I have just described.

A hundred and eighteen years have passed since the Bank of Japan was established. And, yet, it is also a 'young' central bank as it was reborn two years ago under the new Bank of Japan Law, and thus no track record has yet been established. I believe a good track record will be won by calmly evaluating economic and financial conditions, fully explaining decisions and implementing them, and giving due consideration to constructive criticism from those who know the importance of having a central bank which can be trusted.",,Positive,0.8473362923,,
"Sep. 11, 2000","Speech given by Masaru Hayami, Governor of the Bank of Japan, at the 32nd Annual Joint Meeting of Japan-Midwest U.S. Association and Midwest U.S.-Japan Association in Tokyo on September 11, 2000 (The US and Japanese Economies)","I am honored to be invited today to the 32nd Annual Joint Meeting of Japan-Midwest U.S. Association.

As some of you may know, after having worked at the Bank of Japan from 1947 through 1981, I then entered the private sector where I spent about 17 years, during which time I often participated in meetings of business leaders from both the United States and Japan. At this Annual Joint Meeting, I am told that political and business leaders from both countries are going to discuss the problems that the world economy faces, including the IT revolution and globalization. Needless to say, I am looking forward to learning the results of the discussions.

Some ten to fifteen years ago, that is, in the late 1980s, one of the main topics at such conferences was economic and trade friction between the United States and Japan. Indeed, I chaired a small group established under the Japan-US Business Conference that discussed the resolution of disputes, which I found an important, but not an easy job. One of the advantages of serving as chairman was that I had the opportunity to visit a number of US cities, including Cleveland in the Midwest.

Fortunately, the economic and trade friction hotly debated at that time has been greatly alleviated, partly because the cause has been removed and also partly because misunderstanding on both sides has been resolved, which largely owes to the strenuous efforts made by those involved in solving the problems underlying the friction. However, I think it also reflects the fact that over the past ten years Japan's economy has stagnated while the US economy has revived.

Japan's economy saw the peak of the bubble about ten years ago. At that time, Japanese firms and financial institutions were expanding their global market share and were full of confidence. Many of you will remember a book entitled ""Japan as Number One"" written by a professor of Harvard University which was published immediately before the bubble hit the peak. In contrast, ten years ago the United States was suffering from twin deficits, a combination of huge budget deficits and the expansion of current account deficits.

But that was ten years ago. Now, the US economy has been enjoying its longest ever period of economic expansion. The unemployment rate has come down dramatically from 7.5% in 1992 to 4.1% recently. On the other hand, Japan's economy has experienced severe trials since the bursting of the bubble. Such contrasting development between the United States and Japan is most typically witnessed in the movement of stock prices. The current Nikkei Stock Average is a little more than 40% of what it was at the end of 1989, which happened to be its peak, while the New York Dow-Jones Industrial Average has risen four-fold during the same period.

Against this background, we Japanese have recently tended to become overly pessimistic about the medium- to long-term growth potential of Japan's economy. However, I believe that Japan's economy will be able to regain vitality if it firmly pursues economic reforms needed from a medium- to long-term viewpoint, as witnessed by the revitalization of the US economy since the 1990s.

To that end, we should learn lesson from past mistakes. At the same time, it is crucial that we steadfastly implement concrete reform measures while earnestly discussing how to revive Japan's economy. In view of the current boom of the US economy, it may be useful for US participants in this Meeting to draw possible lessons from Japan's bitter experience which began when its economy was still in a good condition.

Bearing all this in mind, let me talk about two issues. The first issue is, in the context of the US-Japan economic relationship in the late 1980s, why did the bubble emerge and how did monetary policy affect the emergence of the bubble? The second issue is, though it might sound a little bit vague, to what extent do differences in economic and corporate management style, for example between the United States and Japan, affect economic growth?

Regarding the first issue, there are various factors behind the stagnation of Japan's economy in the 1990s. The emergence of the huge bubble in the late 1980s and its subsequent bursting in the 1990s was certainly one of the major factors. Although why the bubble emerged has not yet been fully analyzed, we can obtain a few common observations if we look back on the history of bubbles including the case of Japan.

One common observation is that it is inevitable that a bubble will emerge if public expectations become extremely bullish for some reason. And, borrowing the expression of Fed Chairman Greenspan, 'irrational exuberance' prevails nationwide when a bubble emerges. However, intensification of bullish expectations alone is not enough for the emergence of a bubble, for it has to be financed, which is another common observation. As a matter of fact, during the bubble period in Japan, the activity of financial institutions had become extremely aggressive and interest rates had been kept low for a long period of time.

Now, in the aftermath of the bursting of the bubble, we hear various questions and criticisms such as ""Why did the Bank of Japan maintain monetary easing for a long period?"" There were a couple of reasons behind the delay in monetary tightening at that time. Above anything else, prices had been very stable. Furthermore, Japan had a sizable current account surplus, reaching 4.2% of GDP in 1986. And this strengthened the prevailing argument that Japan should continue monetary easing and expand domestic demand to reduce the external surplus, which was another reason for the delay in raising interest rates. The United States advocated that Japan's current account surplus should be reduced through the expansion of domestic demand, but such an argument was widely discussed in Japan as well.

The basic condition of the current account balance of a country is fundamentally determined by the trend of the net balance between savings and investment which reflects demographic and other underlying factors. Economic theory tells us that it is hardly possible for monetary policy to affect such basic condition of the current account balance. Nevertheless, in reality, not a few advocated the erroneous argument which was not warranted by economic theory. I think this was partly because some support was given to a misconception that microeconomic problems could be solved simply by macroeconomic policy. In other words, there existed the mistaken notion that such problems as trade friction between the United States and Japan could be solved by monetary policy.

Looking at the booming US economy while reviewing the experience of Japan's bubble period, I cannot help but feel some difficulty in judging the arrival of the new economy, in other words, the difficulty in differentiating between 'irrational exuberance' and 'rational exuberance.'

Most central banks would perhaps say ""no"" to the question as to whether monetary policy could prevent the emergence of a bubble. But, I think they would say ""yes"" to the assertion that monetary policy can play a very important role in maintaining a stable macroeconomic environment. As we have seen in the discussion based on the misconception about a reduction in the current account surplus, I strongly believe it is important for both policy makers and business leaders to understand and share some kind of basic logic in terms of macroeconomic theory for the conduct of sound economic policy.

Let me move on to the second issue I want to address which is to what extent differences in economic and corporate management style, for example between the United States and Japan, affect economic growth.

Against the backdrop of prolonged economic stagnation in recent years in Japan, there has been growing recognition that we should further incorporate into our system the US style management which emphasizes market-oriented economic management and shareholder-oriented corporate management. Simply put, regarding economic management, competition should be further intensified. The relaxation and lifting of regulations should be promoted. The financial system should be shifted from one led by banks to one led by the capital market. And, on the corporate management front, corporate governance should put more emphasis on shareholders. Needless to say, employment adjustment should be more drastic.

From time to time such an argument goes to the extreme that further development of Japan's economy cannot be expected unless we completely shift from Japanese style to US style management. I think this is overly pessimistic because Japanese style management is not something which never changes, but is rather something which has evolved in response to changes in the economic environment.

Of course, I am not saying that current Japanese style economic and corporate management has no problems. Indeed, I often mention the importance of structural reform, and am sometimes criticized for going beyond my position as central bank governor by making too strong a statement on the subject.

Nevertheless, I strongly believe Japan needs structural reform. First of all, let me emphasize that the growth potential of the economy can be increased largely by improvements on the supply side, that is, achieving steady productivity gains, rather than the short-term boosting on the demand side. For example, if we compare the productivity of workers in 1998, the figure for Japan was about 40% lower than that for the United States based on purchasing power parity in the IMF's World Economic Outlook, and about 30% lower when based on the actual exchange rate. Of course, if the sole objective is higher labor productivity, it can be achieved by investing a huge amount of capital and raising capital per worker. But, in this case, capital productivity and return on capital would decline. Furthermore, growth driven only by the huge investment of resources would eventually reach a limit.

For sustainable growth, we need to establish an indigenous mechanism that promotes growth by combining labor and capital in an optimal manner under given prices and which generates innovation in various fields.

Under such circumstances, we have to deal with the following three agendas.

First, the allocation of resources should be reviewed in light of changes in the economic environment and resources should be invested in more productive areas. In this way, resources would be more efficiently utilized. For example, labor and capital need to be reallocated from the public to the private sector, from low growth to high growth industries, and from less efficient to more efficient firms. Such redistribution would certainly be accompanied by pain, but without it we cannot expect the steady development of Japan's economy.

Second, the legal, tax and accounting systems, some of which are outmoded and can be an obstacle to innovation, should be reviewed. While I recognize that it is never easy to review any system, which inevitably entails conflict of vested interest, we should know that we will not be able to take advantage of the power of innovation unless systems are reviewed in response to changes in the economic environment.

Third, what we really need to see is the emergence of innovators. Changes in the economic environment will create a variety of opportunities for making profits. Transforming such opportunities into profitable businesses cannot be achieved through a mechanical process. It can only be achieved if innovators are allowed to pursue their entrepreneurial abilities to the full.

These three agendas boil down to the problem of how to improve the ability of the economy and society to cope with various changes. Such an ability is always needed, but, when technological innovation and economic globalization are rapidly progressing, economies and societies that can respond to such changes have a considerable competitive edge.

I think the fact that the United States has recently recorded higher growth than Europe and Japan reflects a greater ability to cope with changes which can be characterized by flexibility and diversity. At a recent conference sponsored by the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, Fed Chairman Greenspan emphasized that the flexible US labor market had contributed to recent high economic growth, by noting the seemingly paradoxical situation of low unemployment despite many layoffs.

From these viewpoints, we definitely observe the seeds of changes in the recent development of Japan's economy. Let me give you some concrete examples of such change.

First, the reform of systems is proceeding rapidly. For example, a number of changes have been made in the area of accounting, including mark-to-market valuation, more adequate pension liability accounting, and the review of the relationship between subsidiaries and their parent companies. And, importantly, the level of disclosure has been greatly improved. By accurately showing the performance of a firm, these changes put strong pressure on corporate managers to pursue restructuring and higher profits.

Second, corporate managers have become increasingly aware of return on capital.

Third, the mentality of employees has changed. Japan's labor market, which is characterized by lifetime employment and the seniority-based wage system, used to be perceived by many as lacking flexibility. However, recently we have seen gradual changes in the market as large-scale employment adjustment has begun to be observed.

Fourth, reform of the financial system has been proceeding. Since the autumn of 1998, a legal framework for the smooth dissolution of failed financial institutions has been established and public funds have been injected into major banks to strengthen their capital base. Although there remain a lot of things to be solved, the condition of Japanese financial institutions has significantly improved thanks to the restructuring efforts on the part of financial institutions.

Related to these positive developments, direct investment into Japan has substantially increased in recent years. In the past, inward direct investment was much smaller than outward direct investment. In fact, it was only 200 million dollars in 1996. However, it has been on a rising trend, amounting to 12.8 billion dollars last year. I have great expectations for a continuing increase in direct investment from abroad as it would stimulate Japan's economy through the transfer of managerial resources and business expertise.

Before closing, if I may summarize, firstly, a stable macroeconomic environment is a prerequisite for sustainable growth, and in this regard, monetary policy plays a very important role. Second, to raise the economic growth rate over the medium to long run, structural reform affecting the supply side of the economy is indispensable. I think that the contrast between the US and Japanese economies during the past ten to fifteen years exactly proves this point.

Let me conclude my remarks by quoting the following prayer for 'Serenity' by Dr. Reinhold Niebuhr which I cherish whenever I face challenging issues as Governor of the Bank of Japan:

God grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change,
The courage to change the things I can;
And the wisdom to know the difference.

Thank you very much for your kind attention.",,Neutral,0.7820873857,,
"Sep. 22, 2000","Speech by Kazuo Ueda, Member of the Policy Board, held at Swedish Embassy in Tokyo on September 22, 2000 (The Transmission Mechanism of Monetary Policy Near Zero Interest Rates: The Japanese Experience 1998-2000)","The Bank of Japan (BOJ) has gone through a unique experience since a few years ago. When I joined the bank's newly formulated policy board in April 1998, the overnight call market rate, the key policy instrument of the BOJ, was already below 0.5%. The economy was in the midst of the most serious recession in the post war period, although it took us a little while to realize this. We guided the call rate down to virtually zero in the first quarter of 1999 and followed up by promising to keep it there until deflationary concerns had been dispelled. We finally increased the rate up to 25 basis points last month after having kept the zero rate for one and a half years.

Today, I would like to discuss some of the key aspects of the evolvement of our thinking on monetary policy during the last 2-3 years. In so doing, I would like to focus specifically on the characteristics of the 1997-98 recession, the transmission process of monetary policy near zero rate, and backgrounds for the rate hike in August.

I must confess that I am putting myself in an extremely difficult position, especially on the rate hike issue, because, as reported, I was a dissentient in the rate hike decision. The policy board, however, makes a collective decision. So, I presume that I am responsible for both the rate hike decision of the board and my vote against it. Explaining the two positions in a coherent manner is a tough task. If I succeeded, I could be proving that I am not capable of thinking logically. But I will try my best. To anticipate, the case against the rate hike was straightforward. It was, however, not impossible to come up with arguments to support it.

1. The Nature of the 1997-98 Recession
At the outset, it is appropriate to discuss briefly the nature of the recession that started in 1997IV, which is what we were trying to respond to. Clearly, the most important characteristic of the recession was its credit-crunch aspect caused by the slow and inappropriate handling of the bad loan problem. In addition, the Asian economic crisis, a premature tightening of fiscal policy in 1997 and the Russian crisis in 1998 added to the severity of the recession.

More specifically, the onset of the Asian economic crisis and the absence of fundamental measures to address the bad loan problem finally resulted in the failure of three medium- to large-sized financial institutions in the fall of 1997. In particular, there was a small default in the call market in the case of the failure of Sanyo Securities, the first of the three that went under. The default generated a panic in the money and financial markets, became a trigger for the failure of the other two, and led to sharp increases in risk premiums and the demand for liquidity across the financial system.

Japanese banks, already suffering from bad loans, now were facing difficulty in raising funds. Naturally, they started calling in their loans to nonfinancial companies, especially small firms. Business fixed investment started to decline immediately with the onset of the recession. As can be seen in Figures [PDF 404KB]-Table 1, the decline in fixed investment is the major story about the recession on the aggregate demand side.

Strains in the financial system eased somewhat in the first half of 1998, but resurfaced with the increasing awareness of the problem of the Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan and later with the Russian economic crisis. Even large companies were feeling the pressure of the credit crunch. Many said in our interviews that ""all the banks except the main are saying that they will not be able to roll over the loans at the year end."" Of course, they had to cut back on their investment.

Such was the background for our policy making during the period.

2. The Monetary Policy Response to the Credit Crunch
Central banks around the world have responded to credit crunches in one way or another. The justification for the response has not been unique. They may have been worried about systemic risks or about the risk of generating a serious deflation in the future.

Anyway, a variety of instruments have been used by central banks to mitigate credit crunches. The typical instrument has been the injection of liquidity to the system. This has usually been supported by lowering of short-term interest rates.1 Depending on the circumstances, more unorthodox interventions have been applied. During the collapse of the CP market in the early 1970s the Fed announced to lend automatically to the banks that extended loans to companies having difficulty rolling over their CPs. The Fed even announced to lend directly to nonfinancial corporations if necessary, though apparently they did not do this.

In the fall of 1998 the Fed injected large amounts of reserves to the financial system accompanied by three consecutive lowering of the federal funds rate. The Fed, reportedly, also participated in a meeting to discuss a bailout package for the Long-Term Capital Management.

During 1997-98, the BOJ also injected huge reserves (Figures [PDF 404KB]-Figure 1) and cut the call rate in September 1998, from around 0.43 % to 0.25 %.2 Several other attempts were made to ease the credit crunch. The BOJ supplied liquidity to the CP and corporate bond markets by essentially lending short-term funds to banks against these instruments.

In addition, the BOJ carried out a version of twist operations to flatten the yield curve in the money market. The operations were a response to the steepening of the curve during the credit crunch at horizons of a few months. They also were a way to lower the Japan premium on dollar interest rates by letting Japanese banks acquire funds in the yen money market and then swap them into dollars.

All these measures were attempts to address the credit crunch nature of the recession or to do something about the impaired ability of the private financial system to carry out financial intermediation.

Goodfriend (2000) points out the signaling role of a rate cut in a liquidity crunch. Because the accommodation of increased demand for liquidity usually takes place automatically, he argues that it is better to have an accompanying rate cut to show the central bank's commitment to maintain financial stability.
Incidentally, this was a period of extreme volatility in the demand for money. It is almost possible to detect a negative correlation between monetary aggregates and the pace of real economic activity. Hence, use of a money supply rule, for example, the McCallum rule for the monetary base, would very likely have aggravated the economic instability during the period.
3. The Adoption of the Zero Interest Rate Policy
The BOJ's monetary policy, together with the re-capitalization of the credit guarantee associations and private banks, eased somewhat the strains in the financial system. But the financial instability did not disappear. Toward the end of 1998 and early 1999 the long-term interest rate increased and the yen appreciated sharply, and to levels probably unjustified by the strength of the economy at the time. To be sure, the real side of the economy was stabilizing temporarily thanks to the return of the fiscal stimulus; but there were uncertainties about the second half of the year and after. The rate of inflation was around zero. We worried that a dip in real economic activity from that point on might lead to a vicious cycle between declines in the rate of inflation and real economic activity.

Such a consideration led us to ease monetary policy in an unprecedented way, i.e., to lower the overnight call rate down to zero. The decision was made in February 1999. Eventually, the overnight rate settled at 0.01 % for lenders and 0.02 % or above for borrowers. We followed up in April by declaring that the ""zero rate will be maintained until deflationary concerns are dispelled."" The combination, the zero rate and the commitment to maintain it until a certain set of conditions are met, has been sometimes called the zero interest rate policy (ZIRP) outside the BOJ. I will use the terminology in this talk.

The ZIRP produced significant impacts on money and financial markets and then on the rest of the economy. The yield curve flattened considerably all the way out to 10 years. Rates on instruments with maturities of less than a year were virtually zero during most of 1999. The 10 year JGB rate had been between 1.6 and 2.0 % for the last one and a half years. Stock prices rose sharply in 1999. Differences in yield between corporate and government bonds narrowed substantially. Thus, the ZIRP forced investors to take risks that led to declines in risk premiums in many places. One of the few exceptions has been the bank loan market, where the growth rate of loans is still negative. This evidences the seriousness of the bad loan problem we have been facing.

Over time, the ZIRP, rising exports, fiscal stimulus and investment in IT related areas have produced a slow recovery from perhaps the most serious recession in the post war period. Incidentally, I think that the time pattern of the current recovery can be more clearly seen in movements in the index of production than in many problems ridden GDP statistics.

4. The Transmission Channels of the ZIRP
In retrospect, the ZIRP had exerted much larger effects on the economy than many had thought at the time of its inception. What were the reasons?

Needless to say, the ZIRP involved a lowering of the overnight rate by about 20 basis points, which produced the usual chain of impacts. But the effects of the policy seem to have been larger than justified by the small change in the short rate. The commitment component must have played a large role. I think that there have been essentially three mechanisms through which the commitment exerted strong effects on the economy. They all concern the effects on the term structure of interest rates and, through them, on the rest of the economy.

First, the commitment minimized policy uncertainties especially at the early stage of the ZIRP. In March 1999 some traders in the money market feared that the zero rate and accompanying liquidity injections by the BOJ would be only a temporary policy measure designed to let financial institutions go over the fiscal year end. Such a perception limited the effect of the zero rate on longer-term interest rates. Hence, in April the commitment to maintain the zero rate until deflationary concerns had been dispelled was announced. As a result, interest rates across the yield curve declined.3

Second, the commitment mitigated liquidity concerns of financial institutions. With the ZIRP, differences in funding costs among banks in the money market virtually disappeared. To see why, let us note that the zero rate on average meant zero for all financial institutions given that there were no negative rates.4 And, the zero was expected to stay for at least a few months by market participants because of the commitment part of the ZIRP. Any serious liquidity problem would drive up the interest rate, which would be counteracted by the BOJ. Hence, the ZIRP became a powerful tool to contain the liquidity concerns prevailing in the economy at the time. Some of the pickup in consumption and investment in 1999, I think, was due to the easing of liquidity constraints faced by households and firms. This feature of the ZIRP goes a long way toward explaining why a mere 20 basis point cut in the overnight rate produced such a large impact on the economy --a perspective consistent with the credit crunch type interpretation of the recession.

Third, there is a controversial academic part to the ZIRP. In a sense the ZIRP was an attempt to produce a larger stimulative effect on the economy than the zero rate. Even with no explicit commitment from a central bank, however, rational market participants would expect that the zero rate will be maintained as long as it is appropriate to do so.5 Hence, in order to go beyond that, the central bank has to commit to maintaining the zero rate into the future even after it becomes appropriate to raise the interest rate under a certain criterion.

This point is made briefly by Woodford (1999). Independently, Reifschneider & Williams (1999) carry out simulations using the FRB/US model in which the performance of two policy rules is compared. One rule simply dictates that the federal funds rate is equal to the Taylor rule rate when the latter is positive and is zero when the Taylor rule rate is negative. The other policy rule is similar except that it contains a commitment under which once the federal funds rate hits zero, the zero rate is maintained until the Taylor rule rate exceeds a certain positive number. The simulation shows that the second rule delivers a better performance. Intuitively, the second rule borrows easing from future monetary policy and by so doing compensates for the central bank's inability to lower the rate below zero when desirable.

The ZIRP in this sense comes close to other methods to go beyond the zero rate proposed by academic economists. For example, the proposal for the BOJ to buy large amounts of JGBs is an attempt to affect the long-term interest rate. Unless the BOJ can move the risk premium on long-term bonds systematically, the BOJ should be able to achieve the same result by making commitments about future short rates. Or, the Krugman proposal to reflate the economy can be implemented by simply announcing to maintain the zero rate long enough.6

What then did the statement ""keep the zero rate until deflationary concerns have been dispelled"" exactly mean? I must confess that there was some ambiguity in our commitment. We certainly had the first and second channels above in mind from early on. We knew of the third argument. But we rejected the adoption of the extreme Krugman type proposal if it meant a pursuit of a high inflation target like 4 or 5 %. Benchmarking our policy against the Taylor rule did not seem easy given wide ranges of the interest rate coming out of the rule. I will come back to this point again later.

Our stance became a more informal one. Many of the board members made remarks to the effect that "" the zero rate will be kept until the risk of the rate of inflation falling down to a large negative number becomes small enough."" This was further paraphrased to ""inflation would fall a lot when aggregate demand goes down sharply. Hence, we would wait until we are confident that domestic private demand is on a sustained recovery path."" But such a stance left room for a fairly wide range of interpretation, as we shall see below.

3Tinsley (1999) discusses what central banks can do to generate stimulative effects when short rates are near zero. He suggests that the central bank writes put options on short term securities in order to minimize the expectation that short rates will be raised in the near future. In a sense we achieved the same end using a less formal approach.
4Actually, there were some foreign banks that enjoyed negative funding rates. They entered into yen-dollar swap arrangements with Japanese banks at favorable terms and thus took advantage of the existence of the large Japan premium.
5This argument probably assumes too much rationality on the part of market participants or the central bank. Therefore, the commitment that ensures the first channel does not seem meaningless.
6Similarly, the ZIRP in this sense seems to overlap at least partially with proposals to generate a weaker yen.
5. The Ending of the ZIRP
By the second quarter of this year it became apparent that, with high probability, the economy was going to grow in fiscal 2000 at a much higher rate than the government's forecast of 1%. Naturally, there was much discussion among the board members, as shown in the published minutes, about the appropriate timing to end the ZIRP. There remained, however, the question of how much growth would be enough. Below I will highlight some of the key arguments for and against a rate hike and hope to illustrate the difficulties we faced.

(1) Arguments against the Rate Hike
In a sense it was straightforward to argue against the rate hike. Although the economy has started to recover, it had been in a long and serious slump. Prices are, with the exception of WPI, still falling. Hence, there is no rush to increase interest rates.

More formally, we may calculate the Taylor rule rate.7 The rate turns out to be negative under many sets of assumptions. For example, Hayakawa & Maeda (2000) present estimates of output gap under several assumptions. The most standard one, i.e., the one based on a production function with a linear trend for the productivity term, results in a number like 8 to 9 % gap for 2000. One needs to know the neutral level of the gap in terms of its effect on the rate of inflation. The rate of CPI inflation was around zero toward the end of 1996 when the gap was between 4 to 5 %. This implies that the gap is larger, on the deflationary side, by about 4 % than the neutral level. With a coefficient of 50% on the gap in the Taylor rule formula, the gap term already contributes -2 % to the interest rate. The inflation term also contributes negatively but with the size of the contribution depending on the target rate of inflation and the price index used. The growth rate of potential output consistent with the gap estimate is below 2%. Thus, there is no chance for the Taylor rule rate to become positive under such assumptions.

To be sure, the above calculation is a rough one at best. But it does indicate the possibility that the optimal level of the policy rate is still negative. Moreover, under the Reifschneider-Williams scenario discussed above we needed to wait until the rate exceeded a certain positive number rather than zero.

7I am not suggesting that the Taylor rule is the benchmark we use. I am using the rule just as an illustration of an analytical approach to the determination of the optimal rate.
(2) Arguments for the Rate Hike
One can point out a number of problems with the above type of calculation. Perhaps the most serious one is the following. Yes, standard inferences result in estimates of a very large ouput gap, which would be putting large negative pressure on prices. In fact, this was exactly the line of logic that guided us to the adoption of ZIRP. To our surprise, prices did not decrease much in 1999. Standard Phillips curve type calculations would have suggested a decline of CPI or WPI by about 2% in 1999. Actually, as of December 1999 core CPI declined only by 0.1%, and WPI, by 0.5% over a year earlier. Surely, there were a rise in oil prices and the lagged effect of the depreciation of the yen in 1998. These factors alone, however, did not seem to explain the forecast error. Either there was a serious overestimate of output gap or something was missing from the price equation.

It is not difficult to find reasons for possible upward biases in output gap estimates. A significant portion of investment in structures during the late 1980s and the early 1990s may have been just wastes --of course, the counterpart of the bad loan problem. Instead of using the actual capital stock through a production function, we could regress actual output on a nonlinear time trend and, say, various measures of demand pressure in the goods market, for example, the ""supply & demand conditions for products"" diffusion index in our Tankan (Short-Term Economic Survey of Enterprises) to estimate potential output and the gap. This method results in a much smaller output gap estimate. Depending on what is assumed about other parameters in the Taylor rule formula, it is not impossible to come up with a Taylor rule rate that is already positive.

We could go a little further here. Uncertainties about the size of output gap have important implications for the Taylor rule. Orphanides, Porter, Reifschneider, Tetlow & Finan (1999) report interesting simulation results. They suggest policy attenuation, i.e., to decrease the response of the interest rate to the gap in the presence of large measurement errors with respect to output gap. Moreover, when measurement errors are very large, it is better to respond to the difference between the growth rate of actual and that of potential output rather than to output gap. In other words, the interest rate now responds to the change in the output gap rather than its level. They call this the growth rate rule.8

Most of the board members now believe that, assuming that no major negative shocks hit the economy, the economy will grow in fiscal 2000 at a higher rate than some of the largest, but reasonable estimates of the growth rate of potential output. Then, the growth rate rule, assuming that its usefulness carries over in the neighborhood of the zero bound on the interest rate, seems to give us a positive interest rate under wide range of assumptions.9

I hasten to add that these are not exactly the ways proponents of the rate increase presented their arguments. I also realize that these are rather weak cases for the rate hike decision, but they do illustrate the difficulty of using the Taylor rule type benchmark in the face of large measurement errors in output gap. Even with measurement errors the rule seems to get the change in the optimal level of the interest rate roughly right. Assuming that one's previous decision was correct, the central bank can use the rule to decide on policy changes. But in order to end the zero rate, the BOJ needed to know the optimal level of the interest rate accurately, which turned out to be very hard.10

8In a later paper Orphanides (2000) develops this into what he calls the natural growth targeting rule.
9See also footnote 10.
10Even if the zero rate had been a correct decision a quarter ago, it may have been because the Taylor rule rate was negative. An upward movement in the Taylor rule rate from there is no assurance to end the zero rate because the Taylor rule rate may still be negative. This line of thinking suggests that one needs a special check to see whether the result of Orphanides and others (1999) holds true at the zero bound.
6. Some Final Comments
Let me summarize the major messages of my talk. I think that the ZIRP was a unique experiment in the history of the BOJ not just because the level of the overnight rate was zero but because it involved some commitment about the future course of monetary policy. The effects of the policy on the economy were significant as a result of this commitment to affect expectations of market participants. The commitment was a useful way to address the liquidity crunch aspect of the recession. It also helped to contain expectations of premature rate hikes especially at the early stage of the ZIRP. Given the way the ZIRP was lifted in August 2000, it is probably fair to say that we did not complete the Reifschneider-Williams type experiment.11

It was easy to make a case against the rate hike proposal in August. As I have hopefully demonstrated, however, the analytical foundation of such an argument is less tight than one might think. And, it is not impossible to analytically support the rate hike. The indeterminacy here results from our inadequate understanding of the supply side of the economy. I would add that other central banks including the Fed have been facing similar difficulties. We also have not developed effective tools to deal with mis-measurements and uncertainties in our policy making. I can promise that the BOJ will continue to carry out more researches on these issues, but would like to invite people here, especially academic participants, to join the effort.

11There is room to continue the experiment with the 0.25 % rate rather than the zero rate.

"Sep. 28, 2000","Remarks by Yutaka Yamaguchi, Deputy Governor of the Bank of Japan, at the Conference co-sponsored by the Deutsche Bundesbank and the Bank for International Settlements in Frankfurt, Germany on September 28, 2000","It is indeed an honor to be invited today to address such distinguished guests at this conference.

The duty of a central bank is to contribute to sound and sustainable economic growth through price stability, though the legal description of its objectives may differ from country to country. Furthermore, a central bank has a substantial responsibility in maintaining financial system stability as a whole, regardless of whether or not it has supervisory authority over individual financial institutions. Thus, a central bank is unique in that it conducts its business while always paying close attention to the interfacing of the macro-economy and the financial system. Bearing these in mind, I will discuss some challenges which recent changes in the financial system raise.

Let me begin with the background and characteristics of changes in the financial system.

First of all, I should confirm the profound impact of innovations in information technology on the financial system. These innovations and the development of concurrent financial technology such as derivatives and securitization, which enable the unbundling and repackaging of risks, have greatly expanded the range of tradable risks. As a result, market transactions have become deeper and more liquid, fairer and more competitive prices have been realized, and transaction costs have declined substantially. This has led to the significant expansion of cross-border capital flows and financial transactions. And, with intensifying competition and interdependence, financial and capital markets in various countries have become similar 'in certain respects.'

The reason I said 'in certain respects' is because middle and retail banking, which meets the financial needs of individuals as well as small- and medium-sized firms, continues to be supported by financial intermediaries indigenous to each country. Of course, in the future, such localized banking might be affected by globalization as the advance of telecommunications technology, particularly the Internet, further erodes regional barriers, even for the household sector. Right now, however, it is difficult to envisage globalization, which has been progressing in wholesale banking, to also be observed in middle and retail banking in the immediate future. Thus, a phenomenon, which can be labeled 'home bias' in middle and retail banking, is likely to coexist with the globalization of wholesale banking.

As globalization has progressed in wholesale banking, the institutional distinction among banks, securities companies, and insurance companies has become increasingly blurred. This is largely attributable to the fact that technological innovation has promoted the unbundling and flexible repackaging of such financial functions as settlement, financial intermediation, and risk allocation. At present, major financial institutions in many countries are gearing for the expansion of size and business area by way of consolidation. Such moves should be understood not only as the pursuit of economies of scale and scope by providing a variety of financial services in a comprehensive manner, but also as a process searching for a new combination of financial functions tailored for individual needs. With these moves gaining momentum, regulations based on the current fixed combination of financial functions have become increasingly outmoded when compared with reality. Under such circumstances, even in the United States and Japan where the financial systems used to be based on the strict separation of business areas, financial system reform which grants mutual entry of business areas among different types of financial institutions, has been implemented.

These changes in the financial service industry will exert various influences on the financial system. In this regard, let me mention the enhanced role of capital base as an important example. Under a financial supervisory paradigm that aimed at ensuring the soundness of financial institutions by regulating their activities, capital base only played a limited role. However, as the effectiveness of such a regulation-oriented paradigm has greatly diminished, capital base has come to play an important role as a buffer against risks, and an accurate risk control method, which dictates as a core principle capital base being in line with risk profile, has become an established practice among advanced financial institutions. Bearing this practice in mind, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision has been drafting a new guideline on capital requirements that redefines the amount of capital base corresponding to various risks. It will be interesting to see how the total amount of required capital for financial institutions will change as a result of the new guideline. For example, when many countries are said to be overbanked, it seems to indicate that capital and other resources are excessively allocated to the financial service industry, particularly the banking sector. With the new guideline that more accurately calculates the required capital corresponding to the risk profile of banks, will a similar conclusion hold? And, if examined from the viewpoint of economic capital, will there be any change in the conclusion? If the economy is considered overbanked even according to the new guideline, we will see the reallocation of resources, including capital, both in and out of the financial system. Through what kind of process will such reallocation of resources be realized? This question could have considerable bearing not only on the financial system per se but also on the conduct of monetary policy.

As such, the fact that financial transactions are conducted globally and financial markets have become significantly deeper and more liquid should work to enhance financial system efficiency as well as stability by making it possible to absorb various external shocks through market functions.

However, even in the 1990s, we repeatedly observed financial crises that went far beyond the collapse of individual financial institutions and affected entire financial systems, such as the asset bubbles in Japan and the Nordic countries, the currency crises in Asian countries and Russia, and the failure of the Long Term Capital Management. The increased frequency of crises along with changes in financial systems seem to suggest that while financial system efficiency has been considerably enhanced, vulnerability has also increased. Why should this be? Granted that the adoption of fixed exchange rate regimes and the impetuous liberalization of capital flows on the part of emerging economies were behind the recent turbulence, it is possible to conclude that technological innovation and globalization might have had a tendency to amplify such crises.

Indeed, financial globalization, ignited by innovations in information technology, has dramatically increased cross-border financial transactions, and occasioned intensified competition and interdependence among financial markets in various countries. However, exactly because of such strengthened interdependence, stress will not only affect the country in which it emerges initially, for example, Thailand in the case of the Asian crisis, but also be transmitted immediately to markets in other countries. In the transmission process, stress will not only be transmitted to those countries perceived to have similar economic structures, but also could significantly affect markets, which are not directly related to the stress, through the global adjustment of highly leveraged positions. Indeed, during the Asian crisis, 'flight to quality' and liquidity evaporation took place, foreign exchange stability which enables smooth market transactions extending over many countries was lost, and markets segmented. Thus, once a financial crisis occurs, the depth and liquidity of globalized financial transactions that should absorb the shock immediately disappear, and the wholesale banking market becomes segmented by each country just as in the case of middle and retail banking.

In addition, where there are prospects for profit opportunities, in order to obtain maximum benefits, sophisticated financial techniques backed by financial innovation have to be highly leveraged. While it is true that such high leverage contributes to improving efficiency as long as forecasts turn out to be accurate and the financial system is smoothly operating, once an unexpected shock hits the market and profit opportunities are lost, a sudden reversal of prices could occur through position rebalancing and leverage rewinding. In such a situation, the very activity of individual financial institutions based on sophisticated risk management techniques aggravates market price instability. For example, market wisdom created the use of collateral in OTC derivative transactions as a self-defense measure to deal with counterparty risk. At the same time, as experienced during the Russian crisis, such collateral potentially has the negative aspect of triggering a vicious circle in times of stress where a decline in collateral value could, by converting counterparty risk to spread risk, induce margin calls and the unwinding of positions, thus leading to further declines in collateral value. Of course, from the managerial viewpoint, each market participant would naturally try to contain risk and losses within a certain limit. However, in a stress situation, this kind of individual activity could change prices in a non-linear and discontinuous manner and cause the evaporation of market liquidity at a macro level.

Thus, we may be able to conclude that the depth and ample liquidity of markets created by technological innovation and globalization in normal times could be immediately lost in times of a financial crisis accompanied by enormous stress, and there is an inherent risk that it would further amplify the crisis.

Let me now discuss the financial crisis caused by the asset bubble that Japan experienced in the 1990s in relation to financial innovation. A bubble in the form of rapidly rising asset prices is a phenomenon that has repeatedly been observed in history. In a period of euphoria, asset prices become inflated along with the credit expansion of financial institutions. And, in the subsequent period of adjustment, a decline in asset prices impairs the balance sheets of financial institutions and has a substantial adverse impact on the economy as the credit provision function of such financial institutions weakens. With the benefit of hindsight, such a process is nothing new.

Having said this, however, in Japan we cannot deny the possibility that because the regulatory framework in the late 1980s did not keep up with rapid changes in the financial system, the activities of financial institutions became more risky than otherwise, thereby amplifying the extent of problems. Technological innovation in the capital market made the services offered by banks less attractive, and pressure from abroad for financial deregulation intensified. As a result, banks became strongly aware of the decline in their franchise value, which gave them a strong incentive to pursue risk-taking activities to maintain and improve their earnings. Furthermore, deregulation of the traditional segmentation of business areas and banking organization proceeded only gradually, thus making it difficult for banks to develop businesses that might open up new opportunities for profits. The result was excessive risk taking in lending which was their traditional business. Furthermore, financial institutions can temporarily prevent a fundamental deterioration in profitability from surfacing through aggressive lending. This kind of behavior and a rapid rise in asset prices during the emergence of the bubble that accelerated credit expansion, worked together to amplify the excess in the business cycle.

During the bursting of the bubble in the 1990s, Japanese banks simultaneously faced two problems: the non-performing asset problem and a further rise in pressure stemming from global competition. The interaction of these two problems further delayed improvements in financial system functions, and was a significant factor behind the stagnation of Japan's economy in the following years. Major Japanese banks found it difficult to make sufficient high-tech related investments due to capital constraints, and had to divest themselves of profitable overseas subsidiaries. This had a significant adverse impact on the competitiveness of investment banking, which has tended to yield the highest returns, and perhaps further delayed reconstruction of the medium-term profitability of banks. Furthermore, economic globalization promoted the convergence of factor prices, including property prices, and made reconstruction of the financial system more difficult by amplifying pressure stemming from asset deflation.

What lessons can the central bank learn from recent changes in the financial system and the experience of financial crises?

First of all, innovations in information technology and globalization are ongoing phenomena and will likely continue to change each country's economy as well as its financial system at a rapid pace. For a central bank, this leads to increased uncertainty in the environment surrounding the conduct of monetary policy.

A case in point is the argument that I made earlier on ""overbanked"" market. Such an argument is often made regarding the financial system in countries like Japan and Germany. If this argument is correct, it is envisaged that these countries would witness the rapid reduction of both deposits and loans, and the increase in such instruments as MMFs. In Japan, we hear conflicting views on the issue: while some advocate the need to expeditiously solve overbanking, others criticize the slow growth of money supply, which of course is the balance sheet of banks.

Some may say that the increased uncertainty for a central bank stemming from such factors as, for example, overbanking would not pose qualitatively different problems compared with the introduction of new financial instruments like NOWs and MMFs in the past. However, I think technological innovation has the potential power to more profoundly alter the financial and economic structure over the medium- to long-run.

For example, e-commerce, which develops as it interacts with innovation in financial techniques, has been rapidly expanding at an exponential double-digit annual rate in Japan and the United States, and may fundamentally change the price formation of goods and services. The spread of e-commerce could put downward pressure on prices due to the decline in distribution costs, dramatically reduce menu costs because, for example, price tags can easily be changed, and lead to price destruction as prices can be set differently from customer to customer. In fact, we see examples in such merchandise as CDs (compact discs) and books where e-commerce transactions are 10 to 20 percent cheaper than those in traditional commercial transactions, and merchandise sold with a unit price change of one dollar in traditional commerce is now sold with a unit price change of one cent in e-commerce.

A decline in the price level and the rapid progress of price differentiation vis-à-vis customers would make it more difficult for the central bank to set a targeted inflation rate and substantially impair the reliability of price indices. Since economic theory teaches us that price rigidity is a big factor supporting the short-term effectiveness of monetary policy, lower menu costs might have a large impact on the effectiveness of monetary policy.

The spread of e-commerce is only one aspect of the various influences of technological innovation, and as such innovation proceeds there will be many other new aspects to contend with. The intrinsic difficulty regarding the conduct of monetary policy lies in our limited knowledge of economic prospects and mechanisms, and innovation in information technology and advances in globalization may further aggravate such difficulty.

Under such circumstances, we should not suppress, by regulation, the development of technology and innovation in the market. Rather, we should strive to provide a supportive market infrastructure, including regulation and supervision, market practices, disclosure, and accounting methods, in a broad context and to make it more robust. The systematic improvement of market infrastructure will contribute to reducing the risk of financial crises, which is the most serious uncertainty. In fact, to this end, vigorous and systematic efforts have been made in the international community, resulting in a plethora of fora, reports and proposals. It is indeed an encouraging development that many international committees are striving to discover and improve weaknesses inherent in the global financial system, and experts of the Financial Stability Forum have been double-checking such efforts. We must thus ensure that the results obtained from these precious efforts are implemented by the authorities of each country and market participants, and in this context I agree to the point made by many that appropriate incentives are needed.

Of the various efforts to improve market infrastructure, let me mention the study called the ""Fisher II"" project, being undertaken by the Multi-disciplinary Working Group on Enhanced Disclosure, chaired by Mr. Peter Fisher of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. This developed from the study by the central bank group at the BIS, and it is currently examining ways to improve disclosure necessary for evaluating counterparty risk in collaboration with the supervisory authorities of banks, securities companies, and insurance companies, as well as with the support of major market participants. This study is important, not only because cooperation between the private financial sector and the supervisory authorities in charge of the financial service industry overall is realized, but also because it may reveal the new boundary of disclosure needed for such public goods as market stability in the context of recent crises. Moreover, we need to check whether or not market pressure, which is regarded as a main incentive, would result in establishing advanced disclosure as a market practice. At present, it is only a hypothesis that more advanced disclosure would lead to more appropriate risk management by market participants, let alone to further enhancing financial system stability through the better grasp of macro risk profile. In this regard, one lesson we have learned from the bubble period in Japan is that although individual financial institutions conducted risk management, which eventually turned out to be insufficient, enormous concentration of risk could arise at a macro level. Hence, we may need some other way to grasp the size and profile of risk at a macro level. Still, the study of how financial institution disclosure should be pursued has the possibility of linking financial system stability at a macro level to the incentives of individual market participants, and I believe it is worthwhile to explore such a possibility to the maximum extent.

The next issue is how the central bank and the authorities should respond to increased uncertainty that cannot be directly controlled. Recently, many countries have experienced the fluctuation of asset prices, which is one example of uncertainty. Here, one issue is the difficulty of identifying whether such fluctuation reflects the arrival of a new era or the emergence of a bubble, and also how monetary policy should be conducted under such circumstances. Allow me to elucidate a little on these issues, which I think important, though they are not directly related to the problem of changes in the financial system.

A key question for a central bank is whether excessive swings in economic activity can be avoided only if price stability is maintained by appropriate monetary policy. While this question requires careful examination, by looking at the experience in Japan, my preliminary answer is, to my regret, ""No"". In fact, Japan's bubble emerged in the midst of favorable macroeconomic performance where high growth and price stability had co-existed for several years. The yen's appreciation resulting from the outlook for higher growth potential coupled with contained inflationary expectations brought about notable price stability during the period when asset prices rose rapidly, which made it difficult for the Bank of Japan to preemptively raise interest rates citing the future risk of inflation. During periods of euphoria when overheating of the economy is not reflected in price forecasts, and the central bank tolerates continued monetary easing despite uneasiness that leads to a delay in taking preemptive measures, the result will almost inevitably be an excess in asset prices and economic activity.

In this regard, ironic as it may sound, favorable macroeconomic performance and price stability seem to be necessary conditions for the emergence of an asset price bubble. This seeming paradox poses a serious challenge to the central bank. If favorable economic performance and price stability that could be perceived as the arrival of a new era in fact turns out to be just euphoria, high asset prices will not last long, and the subsequent correction of asset prices will have a serious adverse impact on both financial and macroeconomic aspects of the economy. Such concern, however, is not convincing enough to persuade those who believe in the arrival of a new era to restrain ambitious investments. In many cases, the arrival of a new era and euphoria are both triggered by such changes in the environment as technological innovation, and it is never an easy task for anybody to judge whether the change witnessed in the middle of euphoria is simply more euphoria or if a new era is being ushered in.

Technological innovation significantly raises such uncertainty. Generally speaking, in a situation where uncertainty surrounding the economy increases, prevailing thinking is that the central bank should conduct monetary policy more carefully and cautiously. At the same time, not a few criticize that such a gradualist approach to monetary policy might well end up in 'too little, too late.' Some even argue that monetary policy should be decided from the viewpoint of the 'minimax theorem', which aims at minimizing damage in the worst scenario. According to this theorem, the central bank should first compare two policy options, for example, to erroneously tighten monetary conditions despite the arrival of the new economy and thus deprive the economy of an opportunity to raise growth potential on the one hand, or to misunderstand a bubble as part of the transition process to the new economy and continue monetary easing on the other hand. And it should conduct monetary policy by judging which one of these two policy options is likely to result in a less worse scenario. I suspect many central banks will perhaps be required to make such a comparison in the conduct of monetary policy.

Today, I have discussed some problems resulting from changes in the financial system that central banks face and how they should respond. Despite the various efforts I have outlined, the probability of a financial crisis occurring can never be reduced completely to zero. With this in mind, a central bank should enhance its crisis management ability. In this context, it is necessary to conduct risk monitoring and analysis while paying close attention to the increasingly globalized financial system, and to strengthen a cooperative framework among central banks to deal with risks once they materialize. Of the various efforts made toward this end, the BIS Committee on Global and Financial Systems that I have the honor of chairing, has been actively working, as its primary mission, to discover potential market vulnerability at an early stage and to propose remedial measures, often in collaboration with the BIS sister committees. For example, based on the analyses of the recent international financial crises, we have put forward suggestions for a method of disclosing foreign exchange reserves, a market design for enhancing liquidity, and a way to improve statistics with regard to international fund flows.

At the outset, I said: ""A central bank is unique in that it conducts its business while always paying attention to the interfacing of the macro-economy and the financial system."" I think what is required of a central bank is to conduct appropriate monetary policy while giving due consideration to this unique feature, and at the same time to contribute to developing a market design in a broad context while strengthening close cooperation and dialogue with other public authorities as well as private financial institutions.",,Positive,0.8399090767,,
"Oct. 5, 2000","Speech given by Masaru Hayami, Governor of the Bank of Japan, at Kisaragi-kai in Tokyo on October 5, 2000 (The Impact of Innovation in Information and Communications Technology on Financial Systems )","It is an honor to be invited and given this opportunity to speak at Kisaragi-kai. Today, I would like to share with you our thoughts on changes in Japan's financial system against the backdrop of the rapid pace of innovation in information and communications technology, and how, under such circumstances, we should continue improving both the stability and efficiency of the financial system.

The recent rapid evolution of information and communications technology, which is generally called the 'IT revolution,' has been exerting a profound impact on economies and finance as a whole. In the United States where such technological innovation has been one of the driving forces behind the longest period of economic expansion in its history, there are views that a new economy that is totally different from the old economy has been born. Some even claim it is comparable to the Industrial Revolution of the nineteenth century. Though it will be a long time before economic historians can make an objective assessment of innovation in information and communications technology, which is still under way, there is no doubt that it has had a profound impact on economies and finance as a whole.

Indeed, I don't think I need tell you that technological innovation has brought about the speedy processing and transmission of information enabling a substantial reduction in costs, wider networking, and globalization on an unprecedented scale and scope. Moreover, it has affected a wide range of industries, having a particularly dramatic impact on the financial services industry.

Man created an instrument called 'money,' which is a unit of account, a means of exchange, and a store of value, for the smooth execution of economic activity. The financial services industry is closely related to this instrument we call money, and its core business is based on information processing and networking. Therefore, the financial services industry has been a major user of information and communications technology, and, significantly, it is an industry that can easily take advantage of technological innovation. As we all know, computers and exclusive communications networks have greatly contributed to improving the efficiency and safety of business, for example, in retail deposit taking where an enormous amount of information must be processed and recorded as well as in fund transfers and domestic and foreign exchange where extensive networks are required. Furthermore, the recent rapid growth of derivatives and securitization has been made possible through downsizing and the spread of computers.

Changes in the financial system stemming from the recent advance of information and communications technology are not limited to improving the efficiency of traditional businesses and enabling the development of new instruments in specific fields. Here, a good example is the development of a new supply channel for financial services, namely the Internet, which has made it possible to establish extensive and low-cost financial networking. Traditionally, the provision of financial services was very much dependent on the branch networks of financial institutions. But now, information and communications technology has enabled the more diversified and convenient provision of financial services, including via the Internet and unmanned ATM networks.

The creation of a new supply channel for financial services has substantially reduced the cost of financial transactions. For example, Internet banking has greatly lowered the processing cost of banking. According to research conducted in the United States, in some cases processing by the Internet is estimated to cost less than one hundredth what it does at a bank branch window.

Furthermore, the emergence of a new supply channel for financial services and the substantial reduction in processing costs have brought forth changes in the composition of financial service providers. One example is entry into financial services by non-financial business firms. While the provision of financial services was traditionally via the branch networks of financial institutions featuring vaults and lobbies, the emergence of new supply channels such as Internet banking and unmanned ATM networks has made it possible to convert without much difficulty networks used for non-financial activities into ones that can provide financial services.

The reduction in processing costs of financial transactions and the easy conversion of non-financial networks to financial ones have created a profitable opportunity for non-financial business firms to enter the financial services industry by selecting such specialized areas as payment and settlement without needing the synergies obtained from accepting deposits and extending loans. Because entry into selected financial services has become possible, it appears that the initial entry cost has been further reduced and the incentive for non-financial business firms to enter the sector further strengthened.

Following revision of the Securities and Exchange Law in 1998 that permitted entry into the securities field through simple registration instead of licensing, quite a few non-financial business firms began to engage in securities activities. And recently, some non-financial business firms have announced plans to start banking operations. Such active entry into banking has not been seen since 1993 when the Financial System Reform Law was enacted and securities houses began entering the banking area through subsidiaries. The reduction in entry costs, thanks to technological innovation in information and communications, has enabled not only mutual entry into each other's field between banks and securities houses within the financial services industry, but also new entry into the financial services industry by non-financial business firms.

The advance of information and communications technology has not only strengthened the incentive of non-financial business firms to engage in banking but also urged existing financial institutions to review their management. Recently we have observed various forms of alliances and reorganization among financial institutions, and particularly conspicuous is the movement of major financial institutions toward M&A and consolidation among themselves. The main aim of the movement toward mega-banks is for financial institutions with different niches to strengthen competitiveness by complementing each other. Under the current situation where information and communications systems might strongly affect competitiveness, it is indispensable that financial institutions effect huge IT-related investments to strengthen their competitive position. Thus, it cannot be denied that the incentive to rationalize IT-related investments in overlapping fields, thereby alleviating the financial burden and making it possible to increase IT-related investments in strategic areas, has been a big driving force behind financial consolidation.

While innovation in information and communications technology will bring about advances, diversification, and improved efficiency, thus eventually leading to better services for users, it is also true that more information-oriented financial services and networking will give rise to greater and more complex risks, the quicker transmission of such risks, and possibly new types of risks. For example, the diversification and greater use of derivatives has resulted in more complex and bigger risks. Moreover, financial globalization has further deepened the linkage of financial markets both at home and abroad, thus significantly increasing risk of financial turbulence in one market being transmitted to other markets overseas. The spread of financial networks has further exacerbated the possibility of illegal entry into computer systems by hackers, leading to the diversification and proliferation of operational risks.

What should be our basic attitude toward changes in the financial system generated by innovation in information and communications technology? Given that innovation will further proceed in terms of both transmission speed and scope, and since it is a major driving force promoting structural reform, one of the most important agendas for the current Japanese economy, we have no alternative but to embrace innovation and try to reap the maximum benefits.

Before I elucidate on this, let me summarize the main points of what follows. First, technological innovation proceeds very rapidly, and it is not easy to foresee its impact on the financial system. Under such circumstances, we should be positive and flexible in responding to changes in the financial system. Second, it is not appropriate to maintain financial system stability through traditional ex-ante regulations since they would nip the seed of private sector innovation in the bud and weaken the dynamism of financial markets. To realize both an active and stable financial system, we rather need to emphasize risk management and market discipline.

There is a possibility that innovation will ultimately make the existing financial system obsolete, threaten the status of financial institutions that have traditionally provided financial services, change the nature of deposits at banks, and eventually the currency created by the central bank. In view of accelerating technological innovation, those who are involved in the financial system, including the central bank, should bear such possibilities in mind. But before that eventuality occurs, existing financial institutions will most likely strive to improve the financial services they offer by taking advantage of technological innovation. Thus, it can be anticipated that competition between existing financial institutions and the new entrants will continue for a long time.

So far, changes in the financial system generated by innovation in information and communications technology have been gradual with the existing framework being improved step by step. For example, non-financial business firms, which intend to enter the payment area, will establish subsidiaries to acquire banking licenses and accept deposits, which are the traditional medium of payment, rather than establish firms that will introduce a new medium of payment. This suggests that, in such areas as payment where the existing infrastructure can be utilized, at least for the time being traditional institutions and transaction channels, like banks and deposits, will be more useful than otherwise. In other words, technological innovation has progressed to the point where barriers to non-financial business firms entering financial services have been lowered, but not to the extent where the existing framework has been made completely obsolete.

It appears that rapid technological innovation and subsequent changes in the financial system have thus far had little effect on the fundamental functions of finance, including the transfer of funds from fund surplus to fund shortage sectors, the reallocation of risks, and payment and settlement.

To summarize so far, while it is true that technological innovation may significantly change the financial system, there exists great uncertainty regarding the extent and speed of change. Therefore, when responding to change, we should be positive and flexible while paying close attention to uncertainty.

Then, what should we do to reconstruct an efficient and stable financial system under the rapid advance of information and communications technology? In Japan we have traditionally emphasized detailed ex-ante regulations and specific guidelines for individual financial institutions as ways to maintain financial system stability. It cannot be denied that such measures have, to some extent, contributed to the stability of Japan's financial system characterized by the strict segmentation and specialization of business areas. However, over dependence on ex-ante regulations and specific guidelines will undermine the incentive for management to pursue differentiation because the development of new instruments is not linked to initial rewards attaching to innovators, thereby leading to the spread of a 'keep up with the Joneses' mentality among financial institutions. Furthermore, we might have to pay a huge price in terms of the weakened vitality of the financial system as innovation and competition are hindered. Currently, the 'Big Bang,' which is based on the basic principle of free, fair, and global, is being promoted in Japan, and we have effected a wide range of reforms, such as the diversification of financial instruments and services, the promotion of competition in the financial services industry, and the improvement of financial markets. These reforms are much needed to invigorate financial markets, and should be further effected as expeditiously and steadily as possible.

The truth of the matter is that with the rapid advance of innovation in financial technology we can no longer maintain financial system stability solely through traditional ex-ante regulations. It has become impossible for the authorities to foresee changes and the direction of financial markets and transactions and to implement detailed regulations in advance.

When changes are dramatic and entail a lot of uncertainty, it is important to further emphasize risk management and market discipline in order to maintain financial system stability without impairing its efficiency. Though we cannot exclude uncertainty regarding the impact of the advance of information and communications technology on the financial system, what is crystal clear is that financial institutions will need a risk management ability corresponding to the advances in information and communications technology. It is thus a prerequisite for financial institutions to improve risk measurement methods so as to accurately grasp more complex risks and establish an appropriate capital base in order to win amid intense competition. In the process of innovation, risk management is also the object of innovation, and only those who succeed in risk management will be able lead the world. Technological innovation has made traditional thinking that believes risk management is a cost completely outmoded. Financial institution management must realize that risk management is a way to maximize profits. While risk management has hitherto been primarily concerned with the management of credit risk, in the future financial institutions will have to construct advanced risk management systems covering operational risk and interest rate risk in banking accounts, and also establish a high quality capital base consistent with the level of risks they carry.

To establish a more efficient and stable financial system, market discipline is important. It is necessary that financial institutions constantly strive for sound management and higher profitability fully realizing that their every move is being closely monitored by the market. From this viewpoint, it becomes important for them to actively disclose their financial conditions according to appropriate accounting methods. In this regard, we have received criticism from abroad that accounting methods and disclosure standards in Japan need to be improved in a number of areas. In response, I have to say that based on the lessons we learned from the bursting of the bubble we have been rapidly improving the infrastructure related to disclosure, including improvement of the standards for write-off and the provisioning of non-performing assets. Also, consolidated balance sheets have been refined and mark-to-market accounting expanded from the viewpoint of international compatibility. In the area of corporate information disclosure, markets have begun to positively evaluate those firms that see legally required disclosure standards as minimum standards and which at their own initiative disclose management strategy and financial conditions beyond such minimum standards. I hope these movements will further prevail and take firm root in Japan.

How should the Bank of Japan respond to changes in the financial system as innovation in information and communications technology progresses? Before examining this issue, let me begin by briefly reviewing the role of the Bank of Japan in the context of the financial system and the payment system.

In general, banknotes issued by the central bank finalize the payment of transactions when handed over to transaction counterparties. Similarly, current accounts with the central bank can also finalize payment, a function which is supported by public confidence in the central bank. As such, settlements through the liabilities of the central bank, namely banknotes and current accounts, possess 'finality' in the sense that they completely settle payment. Furthermore, various private sector clearing systems eventually complete fund settlement as well as securities settlement by directly or indirectly making use of the medium of settlement with finality conferred by the central bank. Thus, each payment system is operated in a responsible manner by a respective steering body, and the central bank is responsible for maintaining the smooth and safe operation of the nation's overall payment systems.

Article 1 of the Bank of Japan Law clearly stipulates that the Bank's mission is to maintain the smooth and stable operation of Japan's payment and settlement systems: ""The objective of the Bank of Japan, ... , is to issue banknotes and to carry out currency and monetary control. In addition ..., the Bank's objective is to ensure the smooth settlement of funds among banks and other financial institutions, thereby contributing to the maintenance of an orderly financial system.""

To fulfill this mission, the Bank of Japan performs a variety of functions. First, it provides the medium of settlement in the form of Bank of Japan notes and current account services, and constantly strives to improve efficiency and safety. Its function to examine the authenticity of banknotes and prevent counterfeiting while securing the efficient circulation of banknotes lays the foundation for public confidence in banknotes. Furthermore, the Bank has been making various efforts to improve the efficiency and safety of the settlement system for funds and government securities by providing online services for current accounts through the BOJ-NET system.

In addition to such efforts, the Bank of Japan conducts on-site examinations and off-site monitoring of financial institutions that hold current accounts with it, and obtains information regarding their financial strength and risk management. If a financial institution faces a liquidity shortage that might seriously impair the smooth operation of payment systems, the Bank of Japan will provide liquidity as the lender of last resort, thereby preventing systemic risk from emerging.

With this preamble, let me turn to the role of the Bank of Japan in securing efficient and safe payment systems, thereby maintaining financial system stability under innovation in information and communications technology. Payment systems in Japan consist of those operated by the Bank of Japan and private sector ones. In view of the fact that payment systems are a fundamental infrastructure for economic activity, it is always important to maintain the safety of payment systems as a whole regardless of whether technological innovation creates a new provider, a new channel, or a new means of payment. In this regard, all related parties, that is, financial institutions, the steering bodies of private payment systems, and the central bank, need to be in close contact and make efforts to discharge their respective responsibilities.

The Bank of Japan provides a settlement service called BOJ-NET. BOJ-NET is the core settlement system for yen funds and government securities and is participated in by major financial institutions and private payment systems. We continue to make efforts to accurately grasp new waves of innovation in information and communications technology and to make our settlement systems support the advances of financial institutions and private payment systems.

The Bank of Japan is currently making preparations so that current account transactions and the settlement of government securities will be executed by real time gross settlement, RTGS, from the beginning of next year. There are two current account settlement methods: fixed time net settlement is where settlement is finalized by paying net debit or credit balances among financial institutions at a pre-designated time, and real time gross settlement is where each settlement is finalized on a real time basis without calculating net debit or credit balances. Most settlements are presently fixed time net settlement though it has the serious drawback that if one of the participating financial institutions fails to make a payment, then all settlements of all financial institutions will be disrupted. To overcome this we will abolish, in principle, fixed time net settlement and introduce real time gross settlement from January next year. It is recognized globally that real time gross settlement is appropriate for large fund settlements like interbank transactions since it reduces systemic risk, in which a chain reaction of defaults arises.

There have recently been discussions in the securities industry that the settlement period between contract and delivery should be shortened for transactions in equities and government securities. The current practice is to settle such transactions within three days after the contract. Many argue that settlement should be one day after the contract, which is basically the right direction from the viewpoint of reducing the outstanding amount of unsettled transactions so as to enhance safety of the settlement system. Such discussions have indeed been promoted by the rapid improvement of information processing capabilities and communication speed under the advance of technological innovation. We will constantly strive to improve the services we offer so that we will be able to appropriately support future changes in settlement practices.

Moreover, in order for BOJ-NET to contribute to greater efficiency and enhanced safety of Japan's payment systems as a whole, we must cooperate with the steering bodies of private payment systems. For example, it is possible to conceive a situation in which we cannot easily enhance the safety of payment systems when one system among various systems is deficient in terms of risk management and settlements become concentrated on this one system. In particular, although technological innovation enhances profitability and transaction convenience, it also creates new kinds of risks and increases the degree of risk involved, thus making coordination with private payment systems all the more important. In collaboration with other central banks, we have been working to establish internationally agreed core principles that major private payment systems must comply with. In this regard, Lamfalussy standards, which were established ten years ago, are well known worldwide, and, based on these standards, the drafting of new core principles is in progress. With these principles as a guideline, we will continue to closely monitor private payment systems and ensure that they continuously pursue greater efficiency and safety, which is often called 'oversight' abroad.

Innovation in information and communications technology has raised a new issue about our relationship with individual financial institutions. Since their financial strength and risk management might have a big adverse impact on the efficiency and stability of the financial system as a whole, it is an important issue for the central bank to evaluate its business relationship with individual financial institutions. As I mentioned, we have recently begun to observe a new provider of payment services such as institutions that specialize in Internet banking. If a banking subsidiary of a non-financial business firm requests to open an account with us, we will decide whether to enter into a business relationship with it in light of the already published standards for account opening and by examining such factors as its capital base in comparison with the intrinsic risks faced, the relationship with its parent, and its contingency plans. The Bank of Japan has been paying close attention to how such subsidiaries might develop payment operations because their activity might exert not a small influence on the efficiency and safety of payment and settlement systems. If we establish a business relationship with such subsidiaries, we will monitor them through on-site examination and off-sight monitoring.

Views are now divided as to how the move toward mega-banks will change risks in the financial system. Some are concerned that the financial system might become more vulnerable to contagion than before because such moves will bring about the concentration of risks. Others are more optimistic and believe that the financial system as a whole will become more robust in terms of risk taking because individual financial institutions will become stronger due to higher profitability and an improved BIS capital ratio as financial consolidation progresses.

At the moment, non-financial business firms are expected to enter banking by first establishing a subsidiary which will acquire a banking license. Amid the move toward mega-banks, many financial groups will establish banking subsidiaries under their respective holding companies. The Bank of Japan will naturally examine those banking subsidiaries that are direct current account holders. However, if parent companies and holding companies have the power to make important management decisions, such as business operation and risk management strategy, for subsidiaries that hold current accounts with the Bank of Japan, then examination of subsidiaries alone might not be sufficient to truly grasp their condition. In such a case, we will need to conduct a review of parent companies, including on-site examinations, to the extent necessary.

Japan's financial system has been changing against the background of rapid innovation in information and communications technology. And, as always, it is an important task for the Bank of Japan to contribute to improving the functioning of the financial system by increasing the efficiency and safety of payment and settlement systems. By responding to this task, we hope that the financial system will function to appropriately reallocate the financial assets of the household sector, which amount to more than 1,380 trillion yen. If such a reallocation mechanism properly works according to market discipline, it will provide strong support, from the financial side, for the promotion of structural reform, which is one of the major challenges Japan's economy faces.

"Nov. 27, 2000","Keynote Speech given by Sakuya Fujiwara, Deputy Governor of the Bank of Japan, at the Fourth Paris EUROPLACE Financial Forum on November 27, 2000 (Recent Financial and Economic Developments in Japan and the Euro Area)","Introduction
Ladies and Gentlemen,

It is my great honor to be given this opportunity to speak again at this Paris EUROPLACE Financial Forum. I also understand that this is a forum, where exchange of views among distinguished participants of different experiences is of special importance. Therefore I reserve the right to ask for your opinions on such interesting topics as recent developments in capital markets and the impact of information technology in the euro area.

Now, with respect to my duty today, I have three topics in my mind. First, I will discuss Japan's economy and the challenges it faces. Then, I will turn to recent developments in the euro area, a subject which is of particular interest to myself. Here, I dare to introduce my observation on the economic structural reform recently underway in the euro area. And last, I will briefly touch on enhanced interrelations between the euro area and Japan.

1. Japan's Economy and the Challenges It Faces
Compared with a year ago, when I gave a speech at this forum last year, Japan's economy has shown notable improvement. The recent economic recovery is mainly driven by the corporate sector, where we witness the increases in production and corporate profits. Against such background, business fixed investment has been increasing, especially in the IT and telecommunications fields. Although the pace of recovery remains sluggish in the household sector, positive developments are observed in employment and income, reflecting the recovery of business activity. In sum, Japan's economy is recovering gradually, with business fixed investment continuing to increase.

At the same time, however, we cannot ignore the fact that Japan has yet to solve structural problems in the economy. In this context, Japanese firms and banks continue to suffer from balance sheet problems, the aftereffects of the bursting of the bubble in the 1990s. And, while the world economy, especially the United States, has registered high growth by exploiting the benefits of new technology supported by salient entrepreneurship as well as the vibrant capital market, Japan has somewhat lagged behind in its ability to adjust itself to such new environment. With a nascent recovery now under way in Japan, constant efforts are necessary to continue to tackle the remaining structural problems head on, which in turn should be the prerequisite for sustainable growth.

Important progress has already been observed, though, in the financial sector. Bank capital base has been strengthened by the injection of public money. There has also been a progress in reinforcing safety nets. On top of that, the consolidation of financial institutions, especially large ones, is in progress, something which Japan has never experienced since the end of the World War II. I sincerely hope these changes will beef up the profitability and competitiveness of financial institutions, thereby enhancing the efficiency and stability of the financial system as a whole.

Meanwhile, ongoing corporate restructuring process may exert downward pressure on the economy in the short run. But I believe this should facilitate efficient allocation of resources to high-growth industries, contributing to sustainable growth in the long run.

To accelerate such structural change, determined efforts on the part of policy makers are also important. Such efforts should include deregulation, tax reform, and improvement of accounting and legal systems. The Bank of Japan, as a central bank, must contribute to ensuring a stable macroeconomic environment through appropriate monetary policy measures, which will form the basis for creative and future-oriented corporate activity. In addition to this, the Bank of Japan assumes important responsibilities in improving the financial market and payment system infrastructure. The start of real-time gross settlement of fund transfers and government bond transfers from the beginning of next year is one of such efforts.

2. Dynamism of the Euro Area Economy
When I think about structural reforms in the Japanese economy, I always think of the experiences of the euro area economy on this front.

Today, nobody doubts the importance of structural reform, but it is difficult to achieve a social and political consensus as to the most practical approach. Reform is accompanied by pain, and also takes a long time to bear fruit. But once the direction is set, reform calls for further reform, thereby generating autonomous momentum. Developments in the euro area economy have much considerable implications and are encouraging to us. I realize it may sound too simplistic but the essence of reform lies in market integration.

I say this because market integration leads to intensified competition. In the euro area, mergers and acquisitions are a driving force for corporate restructuring and industry reorganization. This increase in M&A, which started from around 1997, was no doubt sparked by the introduction of the euro. In addition, firms are being forced to change their management strategy so that they can survive amid global competition and keep up with technological innovation. Indeed, firms are increasingly aware that efficient management and higher profitability are more important today than ever, and such recognition is evident in recent M&A examples. These days firms are not expanding their business fields, but rather streamlining businesses that they have little competitive edge in, and beefing up the ones that are strategically important.

Market integration in the euro area has also brought about dynamic changes in the economic infrastructure, including transportation, electric power, telecommunications, and finance. In the area of finance, some examples of positive developments include the creation of new payment systems, such as TARGET (Trans-European Automated Real-time Gross Settlement Express Transfer), the rapid expansion of capital markets, and the merger and integration of stock exchanges. In addition, the euro area has begun to review tax systems and labor practices.

Amid the sea change of market integration and the introduction of the euro, deregulation and market infrastructure consolidation are being seen. And the private sector is making the most of resources, so to strengthen competitiveness. Thus, market integration accelerates momentum for competition, and in turn stimulates momentum for reform in other areas of the economy and finance. I believe that every economy has the potential for growth. The problem is how to realize such potential. Structural reform seems to be a trigger in this regard.

I know that some are skeptical about the euro area economy. Such voices often argue that the weak economy is the reason for the weak euro. For example, they say that structural rigidity of the euro area economy, or the difference in productivity between the United States and the euro area, has induced the massive outflow of capital to the United States thus causing the euro to weaken.

The mechanism behind exchange rates is very complex, and as a central banker, I ought not to make any careless remarks on this delicate subject. However, I have to say we should not hastily assume that the weak euro merely reflects a weak economy. Capital outflows across the Atlantic could be the result of intensified global competition that has stimulated various types of strategic alliances across the border.

Integration of the European markets and the introduction of a common currency are historically the most remarkable events since the collapse of the Bretton Woods system nearly thirty years ago. As such, they can be characterized as part of a project which has the potential to dramatically change the landscape of the world economy. With this in mind, I will continue to keep a close watch on economic developments in the euro area.

3. Interrelations between the Euro Area and Japan
Lastly, I would like to give my view on interrelationships between the euro area and Japan, focusing on capital flows. As I have mentioned, in the euro area, monetary union has triggered various kinds of structural change, bolstering the development of the overall economy. The impact is so large that it has affected not only the euro area itself, but also Japan.

An example of the effect is direct investment. Direct investment from western Europe to Japan soared more than tenfold in a year, from about 100 billion yen in 1998 to over 1 trillion yen in 1999. Investment from France was especially large, which reflects the capital collaboration that was seen in the automobile industry. Direct investment from Japan to the euro area is also on the rise. The increase in direct investment will promote the reallocation of management resources, technology transfer, and competition, resulting in boosting both economies.

The increase in capital flows between the two economies is well evidenced in portfolio investment. In 1999, Japan's portfolio investment in the euro area exceeded that in the United States. Japan's foreign portfolio investment in France, Germany, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg, the four euro area countries for which individual data are available, totaled almost 5.6 trillion yen in 1999. On the other hand, Japan's portfolio investment in the United States was 1.4 trillion yen. This is rather noteworthy, because, in international capital markets, the United States, with its huge current account deficit, absorbs a lot of funds provided by the euro area and Japan. Despite such a situation, capital flows between the euro area and Japan are surging, and both economies are growing more interdependent in international capital markets.

In the increasingly integrated global market, the euro area and Japan are becoming more and more dependent. I hope today's forum will contribute to bringing the two economies closer, and serve as an opportunity to enhance communication between the private sector of the euro area and that of Japan. I know this forum will be a success.

Thank you very much for your kind attention.",,Negative,0.7801051736,,

The first thing to be emphasized is that Japan has finally reached a stage where there are emerging signs of an economic recovery.

At the beginning of this month, GDP statistics based on a new calculation method (SNA93) were released. GDP growth on this new basis was -0.6% for fiscal 1998 but turned positive in fiscal 1999 (+1.4%) and the corresponding figure for the third quarter of this year stands at +1.5%. What should be noted in this connection is how private demand and public investment have contributed to this recovery trend.

When the Bank of Japan adopted the zero interest rate policy around two years ago, public investment for the first quarter of 1999 increased (+13.3%) compared with the previous year. In contrast, private demand such as household consumption and business investment declined (-2.0%) in the same period. However, this contrast has been gradually reversed during the last two years. In the third quarter of this year, public investment decreased (-4.1%) on a year-on-year basis while private demand grew (+1.1%). In other words, the gradual upturn in private demand is strengthening while the fiscal stimulus has turned negative.

Under these conditions, corporate profits as a whole are expected to record a double-digit increase for the second consecutive year. At the same time, employment and household income conditions are slowly improving, as demonstrated by the positive growth of wages since this spring and a slight decrease in the unemployment rate from its all-time high.

Some of you might not feel comfortable with my diagnosis of the present economic situation and we are fully aware that such a perception does exist. In our opinion, this perception typically reflects the very characteristics of the ongoing recovery phase.

'Polarization' of economic recovery
The first feature of the ongoing recovery is that there remains considerable divergence among various sectors or segments of the economy regarding the pace of recovery, which is sometimes called 'polarization.' At present, for example, the corporate sector is showing a notable improvement while the household sector is being left behind. This is clearly reflected in the fact that business investment is markedly increasing although personal consumption remains lackluster. In other words, the recovery trend now underway is being driven mainly by the corporate sector with the household sector lagging. Moreover, the stark contrast between the IT-driven new economy and traditional old economy is also a case in point, and the contrasting picture between large manufacturers and small and medium-sized non-manufacturers is also often mentioned.

At this point, I would like to add further explanation of the sharp contrast between the corporate and household sector. In the corporate sector, the profit improvement is becoming more pronounced and business investment is on an upswing, though firms are not likely to immediately increase wages and hiring. This is because the corporate sector is attaching top priority to eliminating over-indebtedness and reinforcing profitability under strong pressure from financial markets in this rapidly globalized environment. I assume this is the main reason why household and consumption-related firms do not feel any strong sense of a recovery at the present moment.

Vigorous restructuring and the resulting recovery in the corporate sector is a precondition for sustainable growth, but it is highly likely that improvements in employment and income conditions and personal consumption will remain slow for some time to come. However, if income distribution to the household sector is overly constrained as a consequence of aggressive efforts to pursue corporate restructuring, we will face a greater risk, at a macro level, of personal consumption falling, thereby jeopardizing the nascent recovery. In view of the above, Japan's economy seems to be precariously balanced in building the foundation for a sustainable upturn.

Price developments
The second characteristic of the present recovery phase is the continuing weakness of prices. Year-on-year growth in CPI and the GDP deflator has been negative. Under these circumstances, even if sales volume increases it will not likely result in any conspicuous increase in nominal sales. Lack of a clear sense of recovery among business managers also reflects such a factor.

Yet, we can detect some positive aspects in the current soft trend of prices. For instance, the expansion of new distribution businesses - often called 'category killers'- is offering considerable benefits to consumers through their bold pricing strategy. It is said that this new strategy, making extensive use of overseas networks in terms of procurement and production, is providing a new business model for distribution firms. Furthermore, rapid progress in telecommunications technology is also exerting downward pressure on prices, as is typically seen with PCs and IT-related goods.

The weak trend of prices can be explained under the supply and demand framework. With regard to the demand side, downward pressure on prices stemming from weak demand is markedly receding unlike in the first half of last year when Japan's economy was on the brink of falling into a deflationary spiral. On the other hand, downward pressure on prices arising from supply-side factors such as technological innovation, the streamlining of distribution channels, and deregulation is increasing. This downtrend caused by supply-side factors is not necessarily a new phenomenon. Indeed, if we look at technological innovation, it is proceeding much faster in the United States than in Japan. However, given that Japan has various industrial sectors less exposed so far to competitive pressure, we cannot disregard the possibility that the impact of technological innovation and economic globalization might become stronger. In addition, as the current recovery is still gradual with a substantial output gap lingering, we are aware that downward pressure on prices has not been entirely subsided.

As factors stemming from both the supply side and demand side affect prices in a complex manner, it is also becoming more difficult to grasp an accurate assessment of price developments. The Bank of Japan has paid special attention to whether the downward trend of prices is aggravating the economic situation through suppressing nominal income such as corporate profits and wages, thereby inducing a further decline in prices. In other words, the Bank has been watchful of the possible risk of a deflationary spiral. To make a correct judgment on this point, it is necessary to examine not only the development of price indexes, but also the underlying supply and demand balance as a whole, corporate profits and earnings, and the like.

At present, corporate profits are increasing and income conditions of households are gradually moving toward an improvement. In highly promising sectors, the declining prices of goods are helping to revitalize corporate activity. Considering these phenomena, we judge it unlikely that current weak prices will translate into a deflationary spiral.

Financial Developments
The third feature of the present recovery is the slow growth of monetary aggregates and bank lending.

In a normal recovery phase, new risk-taking activities increase against the background of positive interaction between the real and monetary side of an economy. However, this pattern does not seem to hold in the current situation because the financial system, still plagued by non-performing loans, is not sufficiently robust to propel the recovery of the real economy.

I hasten to add that I do not mean to say that any severe financial constraint is acting as a drag on real economic activity. This can be confirmed in our TANKAN survey, which shows that while the number of small and medium-sized companies that feel the lending attitude of financial institutions is 'severe' is still more than those who think it is 'accommodative,' the figure is decreasing. As for large companies, the number of firms that feel the lending attitude is 'accommodative' has been exceeding those who think it is 'severe' since around September 1999. In light of these results and other micro-level information on corporate financing, corporate funding conditions as a whole seem to be steadily easing.

Yet, the pace of easing in this regard remains slower than warranted by the extremely low level of interest rates. Without the resolution of financial system problems, we will continue to be susceptible to adverse side-effects on economic and financial conditions, whenever a problem in financial institution management surface. We have recently witnessed the successive failure of Japanese life insurance companies and credit cooperatives, and such incidents tend to put the household and corporate sectors on the defensive.

In connection with the financial conditions just mentioned, I would like to briefly explain the recent trend of monetary aggregates in Japan. Over the past several years, the highest growth of monetary aggregates was recorded in 1998 when Japan was suffering economic deterioration and financial system instability. M2+CDs, the typical measure of monetary aggregates, was growing by roughly 5% at that time, but gradually slowed to 3-4% in 1999 and further declined to the 2% level this year.

Undeniably, this monetary development does not fit well with the normal pattern in which economic recovery leads to higher monetary growth through robust corporate activity. However, there are several reasons for the recent downtrend of the monetary aggregates.

First, although corporate cash flow remains plentiful thanks to recovering profits and restructuring effects, expenditures such as business investment are lower than this level. Second, until last year, there was a widespread tendency on the part of the corporate sector to hold precautionary liquidity on hand amid prevailing concern over financial instability. But such accumulation of liquidity on hand has peaked due to the effects of various policy measures aimed at restoring financial stability materializing, and more companies are striving to slash both external borrowings and cash on hand in order to improve balance sheet efficiency bearing in mind their market evaluation such as credit ratings. Thus, it might be possible, for the time being, that the growth rate of monetary aggregates will further dip despite improving corporate profits and abating anxiety over the financial system. This paradoxical development regarding monetary aggregates is also one of the salient features of the current recovery phase in the sense that its root cause is associated with problems in Japan's financial system.

2. Challenges for the Japanese Economy
Structural problems and implications of a gradual recovery
The three characteristics of the current economic recovery I just mentioned are closely linked to long-standing structural problems in Japan's economy -- the disposal of non-performing loans created by the bursting of the bubble -- and the necessary response to economic and financial globalization and technological innovation. Thus, with those structural challenges in mind, I would like to think about the future course of Japan's economy.

Since this October, the Bank of Japan has started to release ""Outlook and Risk Assessment of the Economy and Prices."" This report, to be published twice a year, presents a baseline scenario of Japan's economy for the coming one to two years as envisaged by the Bank's Policy Board members, and also gives their assessment of various risk factors. In the first report published in October, the Bank judges that ""Japan's economy will continue to trace a gradual recovery mainly led by private demand,"" but ""because of various structural adjustment pressures, including balance sheet problems and continuing restructuring at firms and financial institutions, expansion of the economy is unlikely to be vigorous.""

Two important messages from this are worth mentioning.

First, Japan's economy at present is in a preparatory stage for sustainable future growth. Structural adjustment has a variety of implications. On a macroeconomic level, such adjustment includes further utilization of competitive mechanisms, deregulation and the review of existing regulations, and reform of the industrial structure. As for individual corporate management, on the other hand, adjustment means shareholder-focused corporate governance, employment adjustments, and personnel relocation, all of which calls for a re-examination of the social and economic system. This process is inevitably accompanied by pain. In addition, the persistent burden of non-performing loans on corporations and financial institutions cannot disappear overnight, and should thus be alleviated by value added generated by economic activity each year.

In a nutshell, although structural adjustment requires considerable patience, it is an inescapable challenge if we are to return to sustainable economic growth. Hence, from this viewpoint, the pace of economic recovery is likely to remain slow for the time being. Nevertheless, we must remain fully committed to resolving various structural problems and not just seek higher growth in a myopic manner.

At the same time, however, I would like to stress another essential point, which is the fact that it is difficult to strengthen resilience to adverse external shocks, given the slow pace of recovery, which will very likely remain the case for some time to come. Therefore, we must closely watch the world economy and developments in international capital markets. I will revisit this later in relation to the conduct of monetary policy.

IT revolution
I would now like to turn to the issue of how to respond to the substantial changes commonly referred to as the IT revolution in light of the implications for structural problems.

The two major problems I have described - the disposal of non-performing loans and reform of economic structure - have long been pointed out since the bursting of the bubble. With respect to the reform of economic structure, its future direction has not been clear for some time, namely it has been difficult to identify areas or leading industries which are likely to support future growth. However, it gradually became clear recently that how to respond to rapid changes in the area of telecommunication and how to utilize fruits resulting from such changes are important questions to be tackled.

Since I am not an expert on IT, I would just like to give my comments from the viewpoint of economic growth, which is obviously a concern for central bankers. There are two points.

First, considering that technological innovation has an enormous impact on the socio-economic fabric as a whole, the IT revolution currently underway might be comparable to the Industrial Revolution in Britain or the quantum leap of the US railroad industry. What is common in these two cases is the large-scale migration of labor to the leading industry exhibiting higher productivity. In Britain during the Industrial Revolution, this employment shift was mainly seen from agriculture to the textile industry. As for the dramatic growth of the railroad industry in the US, it is well known that the numbers working in the railroad and steel industries increased dramatically. Furthermore, among the 14 million increase in the work force in the non-agricultural sector over the past five years in the US, nearly a half can be attributed to an increase in service-related industries, reflecting the rapid growth of IT. Of this seven million increase, three million was seen in such areas as software design and the provision of temporary staff.

As such examples typically illustrate, structural adjustment does not stop at referring to management reform at an individual firm level, but can be regarded as a process through which production factors such as labor, capital, and land are shifted to more efficient fields.

Second, technological advancement has much broader implications than the mere expansion of high-productivity sectors and substantial increase in employment. The essence of the IT revolution is that it triggers a rise in productivity of the economy as a whole, while at the same time inducing profound changes in various entities including corporations and governments.

For example, Chairman Greenspan of the US Federal Reserve has repeatedly taken up the subject in his speeches. The IT revolution is enabling companies to grasp their production lines and consumer needs on a real-time basis. Moreover, it also makes it possible for them to slash precautionary buffers such as inventories, funds, and workers, a point Chairman Greenspan emphasizes when discussing the benefits of the IT revolution. In short, the improved efficiency of information processing has reduced uncertainties for corporate management, thereby enabling the transfer of resources to more productive uses. This, in his view, is the main benefit of enhanced productivity at the macro level created by the IT revolution.

In Japan, discussions are likely to mainly focus on the past development and performance of individual IT-related companies, although there are also various new directions being seen. For instance, some companies are introducing so-called 'supply chain management' aiming at centrally controlling all planning, procurement, production, distribution, and sales not only for themselves but also for their clients. It will be interesting to see how this new system, just one example of recent new directions, will evolve.

This reminds me of what J. Schumpeter, a great academic economist, wrote. He saw the process of economic development as 'creative destruction.' As a driving force for economic development, he propounded a movement which he called 'new combination,' which comprises five elements: new products, new production methods, new markets, new resources, and new organizations. To borrow his terminology, the most visible changes which we are currently witnessing in Japan are in the field of 'new products,' though such signs of change are also being seen in the other four areas.

Conditions for successful utilization of IT
Next, I would like to spell out the fundamental conditions through which we can pursue structural adjustment of the whole economy, aided by technological innovation in the IT sector.

First, labor mobility needs to be enhanced. As I explained in the examples of Britain and the US, successful structural adjustment presupposes the smooth reallocation of labor to more productive areas. Recently, part-time jobs and temporary workers have increased substantially, which is assessed as improving the mobility of labor markets. However, mismatching between supply and demand in labor markets is still considerable, and, under such a situation, more efforts are required to eliminate the obstacles to labor mobility.

Second, it is necessary to rebuild the financial system and revitalize market functions. In this connection, Schumpeter put great emphasis on the role played by 'bankers' in promoting his 'new combination.' In a contemporary context, 'bankers' in a Schumpeterian sense can be interpreted as the 'financial system' as a whole which includes banks as financial intermediaries as well as financial and capital markets. To nurture new industries and businesses, a sound and robust financial system through which capital and risks are efficiently allocated is pivotal.

The desirable financial system framework varies across time and countries. It cannot be set as a fixed goal to be pursued. Nevertheless, what I would like to stress is that it is important for the financial system to foster and embed a culture that credit including deposits, loans, security investments, and derivative transactions is provided with constantly taking account of the risk-return relationship.

Third, various institutional obstacles to innovative activities should be removed along with the strenuous pursuit of deregulation. In this regard, various efforts by the private sector and government have been bearing fruit. However, there are not a few points to be examined such as whether institutional frameworks like accounting rules, taxation, and the legal system are compatible with the new era. Viewed from this perspective, many attempts at utilizing IT are conducive to creating an environment in which corporations and individuals find it easy to bear risk. At the same time, this has an important bearing on facilitating structural reform in Japan. In that sense, I think that the degree of prevalence of IT revolution in the economy can be a measure of the progress in the structural adjustment in Japan.

3. Role of the Bank of Japan
Conduct of Monetary Policy
Given the above, what role should the Bank of Japan play as a central bank in promoting structural reform of Japan's economy?

We cannot expect much progress in structural reform when inflation or deflation is developing. The aim of monetary policy is to contribute to the sound development of the economy through the pursuit of price stability, which is the biggest contribution a central bank can make toward accomplishing structural adjustment. In this context, I would like to briefly discuss some challenges facing the conduct of monetary policy.

The Bank of Japan lifted the zero interest rate policy last August. This decision signifies ""a small adjustment to the degree of monetary easing"" in line with the improvement of the economy as I mentioned at the outset, and that the Bank has not changed its stance to support economic recovery through keeping accommodative monetary conditions.

Looking at various risks surrounding the current economy, because the pace of recovery is still gradual, we need to pay due attention to the possibility of a downswing due to adverse external shocks or the rekindling of deflationary concerns.

While the risk factors which the Bank has been paying attention to were explained in detail in the ""Outlook and Risk Assessment of the Economy and Prices,"" let me highlight two points which I am especially focusing on at the moment.

The first is the development of the world economy in general, and the US economy in particular. While the US economy has been expanding at an above-potential rate, its real GDP growth for the third quarter of this year (+2.2%) is slower than the previous high-growth path of four to five percent. The deceleration of the US economy per se has been considered desirable for ensuring sustainable growth, as far as it is leading to a soft landing. However, at the same time, the slowdown of the US economy might have an adverse impact on Japan's economy, including indirect effects channeled through the Asian economies that are heavily dependent on exports to the US. We should remain vigilant as to whether the economic slowdown in the US will affect sustainable growth of the world economy.

The second risk to be noted is the continuous volatile movement of stock markets in and outside of Japan. If falling Japanese stock prices dampen the sentiment of the business and household sectors or undermine the risk-taking capacity of financial institutions and corporate entities, the recovery could be hampered. At present, the trend of increased corporate profits has been maintained, and there seems to be few signs of adverse effect on the real economy. Needless to say, however, we remain watchful of stock market developments and their potential ramifications.

Monetary Policy and Structural Reform
As I have discussed, the Bank of Japan, closely watching various risk factors, is determined to conduct monetary policy in an appropriate and flexible manner with the aim of supporting the nascent economic recovery and preventing the Japanese economy from falling into a deflationary spiral.

At the same time, I would like you to understand that monetary policy is no panacea, and cannot be a substitute for needed structural reform. Needless to say, over the long haul the source of economic growth should be found in the full realization of private sector vitality with the support of various innovations. In pursuing structural reform, both policy efforts and corporate endeavors to directly address structural problems are imperative.

In that sense, as I mentioned, we need to continuously re-examine our social and economic system and reduce uncertainties and anxieties surrounding various economic activities to the extent possible, thereby creating an environment in which risk-taking is facilitated.

As the central bank of our country, the Bank of Japan provides a variety of banking services, the quality of which affects the course of Japan's economy. Therefore, we are willing to contribute to the reform of financial systems by improving the functioning of financial markets and payment systems. Currently, we are striving to introduce RTGS -- real-time gross settlement -- which will start on January 4th next year. At the same time, we are also exploring the possibility of adopting electronic systems to carry out operations related to treasury funds. I hope that these assiduous efforts will bear fruit in building an efficient and stable financial system.

Concluding Remarks
In reviewing economic developments in Japan, I have presented my view of the challenges facing us and the basic stance concerning the conduct of monetary policy.

Now that we are close to the dawn of the twenty-first century, let me wind up my speech with a brief overview of the economic developments of the past century.

Over the past 100 years, annual growth has averaged 3.3% in the US and 1.9% in Britain. Both nations experienced two world wars and several smaller ones. On the economic and financial fronts, they both experienced rampant inflation and deflation, as well as severe financial disruption. And, it was some twenty years ago that the decline of their national power was debated. As for the recent five years, however, both the US and the UK have achieved average growth of 4.4% and 2.8%, respectively, both of which figures are one percentage point higher than the average growth for the whole 20th century. This is an eloquent demonstration that even mature economies can expand vigorously if they are successful in rejuvenating the dynamism of the private sector.

In contrast, the average growth rate of Japan's economy for the past 100 years is 3.9%. The figure for the last 50 years is 5.8%, and for the last five years, 1.4%. As such, the recent prolonged low growth rate has provoked a pessimistic view with respect to the medium- to long-term growth capacity of Japan's economy. However, I think one does not need to be that pessimistic. As is evident from overseas examples, as far as an economy is an embodiment of human activities, the track of the economy will be shaped depending on how we judge the prospects for the economy and how we act on such judgement.

As I mentioned today, it is true that Japan's economy has been preoccupied in dealing with the aftermath of the bursting of the bubble in the past ten years and thus might have not adapted appropriately to changes in the environment surrounding the world economy as represented by the term 'globalization.'

Therefore, if this was the case, what is necessary is to share a recognition, among ourselves, that we cannot escape the pressure of global competition. With such a shared view, the specific content of structural adjustment which awaits to be tackled will emerge spontaneously. I strongly believe that if the private sector takes the initiative in structural adjustment with the government's support in laying the ground for such efforts, Japan's economy will regain robust growth.

I mentioned that the roles of the Bank of Japan in relation to structural reform are to make efforts to realize economic stability as well as to improve banking services of the central bank itself. I would like to conclude my speech by emphasizing that the Bank will bear these two roles in mind and continue to make the utmost efforts for the development of Japan's economy.

Thank you very much for your kind attention.
